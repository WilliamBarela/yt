"""The only reason it didn't succeed was broadband,"" says Mark Davis, managing partner of the venture-backed company practice at consultancy Deloitte &amp; Touche, which advised Mibrary. ""It came to the point of saying, 'This idea is just too early.' It would be perfect right now."" The Web casts, provided by Sportsline.com Inc. for a $9.95 subscription and free for AOL's three million high-speed subscribers, may not have been possible as recently as a year ago, says FeedRoom President and Chief Executive Jon Klein. ""We would have had far fewer viewers,"" says Mr. Klein, who in 1998 left his job as a senior executive overseeing CBS's 60 Minutes to start FeedRoom. ""There's now a critical mass of viewers for marketers to reach."" Another dot-com era media start-up company benefiting from the surge in broadband is the NewsMarket, a video-archive and distribution platform that allows the news media to access free broadcast-standard video over the Internet. ""The digital newsroom, [powered by] broadband, is transforming how the broadcast media operates,"" says Anthony Hayward, co-founder and chairman of the NewsMarket. ""Those same technologies are transforming how . . . companies are communicating. We sit right in the middle of that opportunity."""
