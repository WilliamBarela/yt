Now, in the budding days of online video and tunes, music executives are getting tougher than ever in licensing negotiations. They are trying to prevent MTV from using its TV clout to crush a groundswell of rivals on the Web. Digital technology has spawned numerous music sites, from homegrown fan pages to sophisticated sites backed by the record companies themselves. They let fans listen to music, watch performances and buy tunes via the Web. And record industry executives want to make sure the sites thrive in the new wired world -- before MTV can dominate it. As for the Web, MTV hasn't asked for exclusivity, an MTV spokeswoman says. In some TV licensing renewal talks, however, the company has requested that competing Web sites not get videos any sooner than MTV's cable channel does, a person familiar with the discussions says. The record companies are eagerly signing licensing deals with MTV's Web rivals, executives say, but want richer licensing fees from the Web than those negotiated by MTV for television. The Justice Department began scrutinizing the music-video powerhouse, a unit of Viacom Inc., several months ago. The agency started looking into MTV's competitive practices in television when MTV acquired rival TV channel The Box in a deal with Liberty Digital, a unit of Liberty Media Corp. In addition to bringing a rival into the MTV fold, the deal also beefed up MTV's Web presence by linking its music sites with Liberty Digital's music sites, such as sonicnet.com and streamland.com.
