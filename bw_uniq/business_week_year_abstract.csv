2000^  Broadband Internet access is the future for PCs, TVs and other information appliances. Several online companies are retooling their offerings to include rich audio, video and interactive media that will take full advantage of fatter Net pipes. But the plain old telephone is making a surprising comeback. A growing number of companies are rolling out Net-access services that work over wired and wireless phones.
2001^  The future is likely to see homes with one full PC and an assortment of other specialized devices such as Web browsers or music players. The main reason this has not happened is that the devices, or information appliances, have so far not been very good. And they remain isolated gadgets, incapable of working together. Also, speech and vision capabilities will likely be incorporated, but currently are not well-developed.
2001^  The people who run struggling online media, e-commerce, and networking companies think they have identified the elixir to revive the Internet: broadband. They are all betting that high-speed Internet service will spur multimedia ads, snazzy video, and the ability to make impulse purchases. Unfortunately, it is a bad bet.
2002^  With PC sales expected to decline for the second straight year as corporate spending withers, Microsoft is aiming its big guns on entertainment goodies for the home.
2003^  After dominating the market for Internet access for nearly a decade, AOL has seen its 25 million US members begin to defect in droves to cut-rate dial-up competitors and to broadband rivals who are beginning to slash their monthly fees in a burgeoning price war. Now, AOL is launching a new effort to stem the tide. On July 31, the company will release the most significant upgrade to its software in years, certainly since the disastrous merger with Time Warner was unveiled in January, 2000. AOL 9.0 will boast over 100 new features, including faster downloads, free e-mail storage on AOL's computers, and an easy way for subscribers to keep blogs, or online journals. Most important, AOL 9.0 will be the doorway to a brand-new world of online content. It is designed to help subscribers tap into a growing number of music, video, and magazine offerings from Time Warner.
2003^  Tired of those trips to the video store to rent the latest DVD? Hollywood says it has the answer in a pair of online movie stores that let you download the latest Arnold or Julia flick directly to your computer. But, like everything Hollywood offers up, the magic is getting it on the screen. Unless you've got an up-to-date PC and a broadband connection, neither site is a real blockbuster. For starters, neither Movielink nor CinemaNow stocks nearly as many titles as your local video store. For those who just want to see Matrix Reloaded, the local video palace still beats these sites.
2003^  After years of anticipation, this holiday season seems destined to go down in the books as the First Broadband Christmas. Thanks to sharp cuts in the price of high-speed Internet access, the number of U.S. homes with broadband has jumped 38% from last holiday season to 22 million, according to consulting firm IDC. That spells big opportunities for e-merchants. Not only are broadband customers online for more of the day than their dial-up brethren, they also spend as much as 30% more. To reel in these shoppers, e-tailers ranging from Amazon.com Inc. to shoe site Zappos.com Inc. are ugrading their Web sites with videos, better pictures, more sophisticated product comparisons, and the ability to customize everything from diamond rings to dress shirts.
2004^Third-generation mobile-phone service is taking off in Europe. The 3G that had provoked a $120 billion spectrum-licensing frenzy during the dot-com boom and then nearly destroyed Europe's telecommunications industry with multibillion-dollar losses has now finally arrived with its promise of cheaper voice calls, fast wireless Internet access, and exciting multi-media services such as streaming video clips and online gaming. Giants like Vodafone, T-Mobile, and Orange are rolling out business and consumer 3G service all over Europe.
2004^Bernardus J. Verwaayen, the chief executive of London-based BT Group PLC, has in the past two years increased revenues, boosted margins, and restored positive cash flow. Verwaayen has now launched another bold plan. He intends to transfer the bulk of the companys core phone network by 2008 to a 21st century network using Internet technology. BT and Yahoo! have launched a leading-edge broadband package that lets customers send e-mail and instant messages, make phone and video calls over the Net, and manage contacts online. A new product, code-named Project Bluetooth, that could revolutionize telephony by erasing the gap between fixed and mobile service is also in the pipeline.
2004^  The US has steadily fallen behind other nations, both in terms of the share of the population with broadband and the speed of those connections. Broadband is the foundation upon which entire new generations of technology will be built: full-motion video, Web-based medical care, more sophisticated Internet telephoning, and online gaming. That's why the US is in dire need of stronger leadership in broadband. Both President George W. Bush and Democratic Presidential candidate John F. Kerry have pledged to tackle the issue after the election. But so far, their proposals are modest. Most markets are cozy duopolies, at best, where consumers can get broadband only from a phone or cable company. To have any hope of joining the world's broadband vanguard, the US must create a viable third competitor. Congress is unlikely to force politically powerful Bells to share their networks. Much more promising is the rivalry that might be sparked by new, inexpensive wireless technologies.
2004^  It looked like a boffo debut for William H. Gates III and his attempt to go Hollywood. Since the debacle, Microsoft has phased out the geeks in favor of Hollywood insiders. The company's goal is to persuade the studios to wrap their movies in Microsoft's software, which the company is offering for free. That way, Microsoft can turn around and sell the software that plays these digital versions of movies to computer makers, consumer-electronics companies, and online video services. The new approach is helping Microsoft make headway. Still, the studios remain wary of Microsoft, given its bruising monopolistic practices of the past.
2004^  Now that Apple has reinvented itself as the king of the digital music world, Microsoft is trying to wrestle that mantle away with a new breed of iPod rivals, including ones that play color video as well as music. On Sept. 2, the company is launching its most comprehensive foray yet into the digital media world. Portable video players, which run on Microsoft software and are made by Samsung Group and others, are just a piece of the tech giant's plan to steal Apple's rock 'n' roll mojo. Microsoft also is opening the doors to an online music store that includes a handful of popular artists that Apple's iTunes site doesn't have. More important, the company is rolling out an update of its Windows Media Player audio and video software that's designed to make it just as easy to purchase and manage music with Microsoft powered gear as it is with Apple's iPod and iTunes combo.
2004^  Advertisers are seeing that the top few Web properties now reach true mass audiences. Each of the 3 biggest portals - AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! - attracts 70% of the Americans online to its properties monthly, according to comScore Networks, a traffic-tracking organization. Demand for this prime real estate is so strong that there isn't enough to go around, and prices to advertise are soaring. Facing a traffic jam at the top sites, advertisers are jostling for spots throughout the Net. The Internet is growing up. Broadband connections now reach more than half of American households, including the lion's share of the prosperous ones. Now that advertisers have their hands on a tool that measures an ad's effectiveness, they're starting to press other media for similar accountability. It's a process sure to cause disruptions. The portals are taking advantage of the hot video market to funnel advertisers toward thousands of their less-trafficked pages.
2005^  The latest Net phenomenon is video blogs, or what some folks call vlogs. Thousands of ordinary people have begun posting a cornucopia of video fare online, from self-indulgent art clips and earnest citizen journalism to sly political commentary. Experimentation is the rule, and eccentrics outnumber serious practitioners. But amid the chaos, glimpses of a commercial future are starting to emerge, including a revival of online video distribution, using vlogs to sell ads, and corporate sites designed to reach out to customers and suppliers. Online video had a brief heyday during the late 1990s, with indie-flick sites with the aim of developing online movie distribution. Those dreams mostly ended with the popping of the Net bubble. But thanks to the blog craze and the proliferation of high-speed broadband, new pioneers are emerging. The development is due in large part to the spread of better distribution technology.
2005^  While broadcast TV audiences dwindle and moviegoing stagnates, gaming is emerging as the newest and perhaps strongest pillar of the media world. So it's no surprise film studios, media giants, game makers, and Japanese electronics companies are all battling to win the Game Wars. When Electronic Arts Inc spent $800 million to lock up ESPN content such as X-Game sports competition for use in games for the next 15 years, it was just the latest jolt to an industry in which megadeals have become as commonplace as laser-toting ogres. Next came the news that Microsoft Corp plans to produce the movie version of its Halo megahit video games, which have raked in $600 million since 2001, rather than handing the job to a studio. Gaming is exploding in all directions - going online, mobile, and global. On Web sites such as Microsoft's Xbox Live, 1.4 million hard-core gamers match up their reflexes in multiplayer shoot-'em-up games for bragging rights in cyberspace. Even the tiny screen is grabbing attention, as cell-phone titles take gaming anytime, anywhere. By 2008, the markets for online and mobile-phone gaming are expected to top $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively.
2005^  The mad land grabs in media and entertainment orchestrated by larger-than-life founders have run their course. In this twilight of the moguls, a new, younger generation of executives is waiting in the wings to inherit an industry in upheaval. Today's executives have to manage in three dimensions -- constantly imagining their books, magazines, movies, shows, and games in an array of digital forms. Back in the fall of 2000, when Major League Baseball came calling, Robert A. Bowman was faced with adapting the 120-year-old game for today's fans. As CEO of Major League Baseball Advanced Media LP, the Wharton MBA decided early on to deliver online and digital services directly to fans, without an intermediary such as Yahoo. MLB.com, with revenues of about $125 million last year, sells 30 services, from live video and audio of full games to fantasy baseball video-games, all available on the Net and on cell phones. No media company is immune to the lesson learned by the loss of 30% of music sales in recent years through illegal file-sharing and CD burning. So Michele Anthony, 48, executive vice-president at Sony BMG Music Entertainment, stumps on college campuses, hoping to steer students away from stealing music. As executive vice-president for business development and digital media at NBC Universal, R. Brandon Burgess is the front-line guy for new revenue streams. Burgess helped in the rollout last year of NBC Mobile, which offers cell-phone users two-minute-long video news broadcasts.
2005^  In the marketing departments of some of the world's biggest advertisers, online video represents a golden opportunity to move beyond the 30-second spots that TV viewers so often zap or ignore. These advertisers view online video as a laboratory for new ways to connect with customers. And they're busy figuring out ways to use the Internet to transform the most powerful advertising tool in history: television. The internet has been promising this video invasion for a decade. But the growth of broadband connections is finally bringing video into the mainstream. For now, the trend is to use video ads online as extensions of TV campaigns. In this new ad world, it's often better to whisper the brand than to shout it. The key is to create buzz and to spread from friend to friend across the Net.
2005^  These are the early days of video blogging. Most of the postings on the Web are rough and tedious - little more than home movies. But the success of Rocketboom and a few sites like it underscore the potential of video blogs. Cheaper video recorders mean just about anyone can make videos, while the spread of speedy Net service means almost anybody can watch clips posted online. The result? The Internet is coming alive with a mix of video, from the polished parody of Rocketboom to the raw interviews of reporters. As these videos flow into the living room, they will reshape what we think of as television. Amanda Congdon and Andrew Michael Baron have no doubt their quirky show is the future. So while Rocketboom shows are lighthearted, the two are dead serious about their work.
2005^  Suddenly, broadband is opening the floodgates for a new kind of TV show -- only not on TV but online. In just the past few months some of the biggest TV names have announced new broadband channels, from MTV Networks to Comedy Central to ABC News. If you thought the 400 cable channels focusing on everything from golf to anime were already cutting niches thin, broadband TV is going a step further. It has the makings of another Internet gold rush. With improved speeds and video quality online, not to mention broadband's growing reach (estimated conservatively to be in 40 million U.S. homes by yearend), TV executives are rushing to connect with younger audiences that are less and less riveted to traditional TV. Getting a foothold on the Internet, especially if it creates buzz, is also a way to recapture ad dollars that have migrated away from the 30-second TV spot. On the Web, ads can be positioned strategically next to programming and measured with greater accuracy.
2005^  As much as one terabyte of data is added to the Net each day, researchers say. That's the equivalent of 50,000 short videos, 250 million magazine stories, or 500 million blog entries. Is there any way to sort through it all to find what you truly want? One answer may be found at a little-known San Francisco startup called digg. Founded by Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, the company's Web site pulls together articles, links, and other info, largely about the tech industry. What's unusual is the method by which content is organized. The company relies on its 80,000 members to unearth the most interesting goodies on the Net each day. It's an early example of the collective strength of online crowds -- and hints at how the sea of online video, podcasts, and blog entries could be organized in the future.
2005^  Is there redemption in cyberspace? That's the question for Brad Greenspan, a 32-year-old entrepreneur who started his first business from his dorm room at the University of California at Los Angeles and helped launch one of the Internet's biggest hits, the wildly popular social networking site MySpace.com, when he invested in it in 2003. Today he's backing what he bets will be the Next Big Thing: a social network site called Vidilife that is using online videos to lure Net surfers, a sort of MySpace for the video crowd. Traffic has been promising so far: 220,000 unique users in October, six weeks after launch in September, according to Internet ratings agency comScore Media Metrix. Vidilife is more than just a business move for Greenspan; he needs it to help restore his street cred as a Net mogul. That's because he never got to celebrate MySpace's huge success. He was forced from the company he founded.
2006^  All Chad Hurley and Steve Chen wanted to do was share some videos from a dinner party with a half-dozen friends in San Francisco. It was January, 2005, and they couldn't figure out a good solution. Sending the clips around by e-mail was a bust: The e-mails kept getting rejected because they were so big. Posting the videos online was a headache, too. So last February the two buddies got to work in Hurley's garage, determined to design something simpler. What they came up with is a Web site, now called YouTube, that has become an Internet phenomenon. In 11 months the site has become one of the most popular on the Net. It shows 30 million videos a day and drew 9.1 million people in February, says Web measurement service Nielsen//NetRatings. That makes the upstart one of the biggest providers of videos on the Net, ahead of Yahoo! and Google and just behind Microsoft, according to the Nielsen//NetRatings estimates. The trouble is, the freewheeling approach that has made YouTube a hit could be its downfall. Users have been posting videos that are still under copyright, without any of the required legal approvals.
2006^  YouTube is evolving into a sort of eBay for video: the first place you go to find a clip, but also a place where more folks are itching to get rewarded for supplying it. A growing group of creative types is furiously producing clips, video blogs, and animated shorts with the hopes of making money through advertising or selling DVDs. While YouTube promises huge distribution, the site and its users are just starting to sort out how to apportion the power they've suddenly acquired. Bob Tur's lawsuit shows the fine line that YouTube is walking as it attempts to build its business model. Tur is suing because his videos of the Los Angeles riot and other events were uploaded without his permission. Although lawyers agree that YouTube should be protected by copyright law as long as it responds to content owners' requests to take down their works, it entered uncharted territory when it recently began adding ads next to search results. The law prohibits a site from benefiting financially from infringement, but the company argues that it's protected since it doesn't sell ads against individual videos. Still, the courts haven't set clear boundaries.
2006^"  YouTube's lonelygirl15, also known as Bree, and her best (and only) pal, the schlumpy Daniel, have been starring in videos posted to YouTube since mid-June. But already lonelygirl15's YouTube ""channel"" is the second most subscribed to of all time, and each video elicits thousands of viewer comments. Bree and Daniel are proof that a secret-handshake-styled series of short videos can be a bona fide hit. Alas, the bookish and cute Bree is not real. Or at least not what she purports to be. A hot and near obsessive debate about all this is playing out in video responses posted to YouTube and on countless blogs. Early chatter suggested a few theories: The videos were a corporation's viral marketing campaign; a teaser for an unknown major entertainment property; or something dreamed up by an obscure Christian sect, occultists, or Scientologists. None of this, by the way, affects the genius-in-miniature of the ongoing lonelygirl15 saga, or its triumph as a new form. No soap opera was ever this good."
2006^  YouTube Inc. is the Internet company to beat these days. With all the excitement, it's easy to forget that the video-sharing pioneer's business so far amounts to a whole lot of expenses, not much revenue, and no profits. Because the company is charting a delicate course in how it handles pirated videos, its legal costs could balloon if lawsuits start piling up. Even more important, though, is the tricky question of how YouTube can make money off its phenomenal growth while maintaining the promise behind that popularity. YouTube could easily alienate its users by overwhelming them with ads. And the startup has to figure out how to attract a broader group of marketers by filtering more for copyrighted or offensive videos and by creating more channels of similar content.
2006^  Everyone from Time Warner and Viacom to Yahoo! and Microsoft is under enormous pressure to acquire the next MySpace or YouTube. But amid steadily rising valuations, Old and New Media executives alike are afraid of overpaying and being punished by their shareholders. They are seeing a valuation gap that sometimes doesn't make sense, says Wade Davis, Viacom's senior vice-president for mergers and acquisitions, who has overseen a handful of Web 2.0 deals whose prices collectively are well below what Google is paying for YouTube. Time Warner Chairman and CEO Richard D. Parsons, still dealing with the aftermath of the disastrous merger with AOL in 2001, has similar concerns. Paying up is less of a concern for a Google, of course. While Old Media continues to suffer from lagging stock prices and tepid advertising revenues, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have huge cash hoards, manageable debt, and, in the case of Google, a lofty stock price. Paying $1.65 billion for YouTube amounts to less than 2% of Google's $130 billion market cap - and the big bet on the video-sharing site could be as much about gut and ego as it is about hard-nosed business sense. Nonetheless, some analysts see a lot of froth in the market, and the risk remains that even highfliers like MySpace and YouTube could flame out if their fickle, youthful audiences decide to move on.
2006^  With all the hubbub around Google Inc.'s purchase of YouTube Inc., it's easy to think that three-minute, streaming clips mark the culmination of the online video revolution. The next few months will see the unveiling of a slew of innovative approaches to dishing up video. They range from the much anticipated launch of something called the Venice Project, by the founders of Skype Ltd., the Internet phone service, to the rebirth of BitTorrent, the video piracy software of choice as a legitimate business. Rather than join the 150 YouTube video-sharing clones dishing up short, static-ridden videos, the Venice Project is tackling the problem of streaming long videos of nearly high-definition-TV quality in a cost-effective way.
2006^  In the past year, cellular-service providers and phonemakers have begun moving to faster networks, including something new called WiMAX, which is like Wi-Fi writ large. This will unleash a flood of innovative mobile gadgets and services that will stretch the definition of wireless as we know it. This latest phase of the mobile revolution is intimately tied to the abrupt rise of media-rich social networks such as Google Inc.'s YouTube and News Corp.'s MySpace.com. Groups of friends crave connectedness, and they achieve it by swapping photos, music, and video clips, immersing themselves in a shared chronicle of daily life. To participate, you used to have to sit in front of a computer screen. Now the handset, stuffed with content you purchase or create, will become your personal television network, your music studio, and your wallet for dispensing digital money. South Korea and Japan have emerged as oracles of mobility. More than 3 million Koreans regularly use their mobile phones to log on to the giant Cyworld social networking site. Both Japan and Korea are starting to roll out speedy WiMAX data networks that can deliver wireless broadband access to entire cities.
2006^  Far from the land of dogs on skateboards and Webcam yakkers on YouTube, the online genre of scripted programs is attracting small but passionate groups of fans. The networks and talent agencies are watching closely, and the phenomenon is giving indie filmmakers new ways to get their works seen. Given these webcasts' ability to generate dedicated followers, their potential seems particularly attractive to advertisers. Advertisers are looking for a Google-like system that will tell them where and when to put their ads next to scripted Web shows. Another alternative would be a site that hosts many such niche shows, so it would have the economies of scale to serve up longer, higher-resolution videos and maintain an ad sales force.
2006^  Six years after the Internet bust dashed hopes that original movies and shows would fly in cyberspace, online production is back. And it's not being fueled by Hollywood suits and high-priced directors who crowded the Net in 1999. Today a small army of computer jockeys from Santa Monica to Brooklyn is quietly creating a New Hollywood by conjuring up hundreds of short bursts of animated or live-action entertainment from their second bedrooms or kitchen tables. Companies are taking notice, placing products in the films themselves or running ads next to the videos. Going a step further, companies eager to connect with a younger audience are hiring these new filmmakers to create commercials. It's a tough way to make a living. Free content on the internet drives the price down for even the hottest pros cranking out films for the Web.
2006^"  Nearly 40 years ago, in a blue-collar Irish neighborhood in Scranton, Pa., Judy McGrath fell in love with music. Her life took a magical detour that led her to write on-air promotions for a new invention, music television. Twenty-five years later, she is chairman and CEO of MTV Networks Co. The $7 billion-a-year operation she oversees is a collection of some of the most recognizable brands in the business, from the original MTV to Nickelodeon to VH1 to Comedy Central. Their programs are seen in 169 countries and heard in 28 languages. Today the girl with a bohemian streak and rock 'n' roll dreams has one of the biggest and most challenging jobs in media. The music channel may have seemed bold and experimental when it began in August, 1981. But the MTV empire today is a staple of the media Establishment and faces a slew of new threats. After all, it's the iPod era, a broadband world, and the online generation is defining for itself what is edgy and new. Ratings may be strong for many of the channels, but the original MTV isn't the must-see it was. So McGrath has declared ""a digital Marshall Plan."" It signals the end of the one-screen company. The troops must now deliver services across new broadband channels, over cell phones, and via video games. No piece of the network is under as much fire as the core MTV channels. And McGrath is doing something alien to the start-from-scratch culture: seeking acquisitions and partnerships."
2006^  A year ago, Yahoo!'s ambitions in the media industry were nothing short of audacious. Yahoo! Inc. execs spoke of creating smash-hit, medium-defining programming for the interactive world. The company furiously set to work on a number of high-profile content ideas, from adapting the abandoned reality-TV show The Runner into a multimillion-dollar Internet program to developing a home-electronics reality contest, dubbed Wow House. Today, after a turbulent year in the media business, Yahoo is singing a much more modest tune. Large projects such as The Runner are in a holding pattern as Yahoo susses out the potential business opportunities. Wow House has been sent back to the drawing board. Yahoo's original content endeavors, from celebrity blogs to the online reality shows, have fallen flat or been stuck in development. Certainly, Yahoo has plenty going for it. The company boasts over 400 million visitors and a media division that streams more music videos than anyone else each month. But its reluctance to aggressively pursue outside content unless it can add its own twist could hurt its efforts to pull in advertisers.
2006^  Their knack for numbers has helped turn the Internet into an advertising sensation. No medium before has been able to provide advertisers with such detailed information on how many people see an ad--and how many respond to it with a click. This apparent precision has helped hoist Google Inc. into the stratosphere. And it has powered phenomenal growth across Internet advertising, from banner ads on smart-alecky blogs to movie videos jumping out from Yahoo!'s home page. But not all the Internet numbers tell the truth. The same technology that's smart enough to target ads automatically, and to count them, can also be engineered to churn out false clicks by the millions. And concerns about privacy are leading an estimated 10% of Web surfers to erase their Internet cookies on a regular basis. The race is on to find new ways to track customer behavior. Advertisers and agencies are tracking the to-and-froing of the mouse on Web pages, and they're finding new ways to group shoppers by age, Zip Code, and reading habits.
2006^  Owners of TV stations once had to try to mess up the business.Oh, sure, there was competition from cable, endless wrangling with the networks you did business with, and costly local news wars, fought with expensive gimmicks like news choppers. But local TV was a relatively undisturbed patch of the sandbox. Then Apple unveiled the video iPod. And ABC started selling programs as $1.99 downloads before subsequently announcing that it would stream shows over the Web, sell ads around them, and not share those revenues with local station affiliates. But sometimes the Web can give back some of what it takes away, and there's untapped upside for local TV guys online. Ad agency folks will tell you that there's more demand for Web video ads--for a local station's site, the ad snippet preceding, say, sports highlights--than there is inventory. The growth of these ads may not make up all the money local TV players would lose should many viewers forsake their local station for streamed or downloaded shows. But given the high prices online video ads command, they might get close.
2006^"  If movie studios hope to dodge the fate of the music industry, whose growth was cut short in part by illegal downloading, they need to come up with a solution to illegal copying. So studios are prodding the feds to put some fear into pirates. The goal: stem the $6.1 billion that the industry estimates was lost to illegal copying in 2005. Half of pirated material is in DVDs sold on street corners, but $3 billion comes from pirates stealing digital movies and posting them online. A global investigation is methodically targeting piracy rings from Chicago to Charlotte, NC, to China. To date, a California investigation has won 24 convictions. The picture that emerges from these investigations is of loosely knit cybergangs, driven more by competitive zeal than profit motive. A skilled ""cammer,"" who records movies in a theater and sends them off for uploading to the Net, can make up to $2,000 per film. But most pirates are in it for the thrill of proving their coding skills."
2006^"  According to angry consumers and the New York State Attorney General, Direct Revenue makes ""spyware."" These programs track where you go on the Internet and clutter your screen with annoying pop-up advertisements for everything from pornography to wireless phone plans. Spyware can get stuck in your computer's hard drive as you shop, chat, or download a song. It might arrive attached to that clever video you just nabbed at no charge. Web security company McAfee Inc. estimates that nearly three-quarters of all sites listed in response to Internet searches for popular phrases like ""free screen savers"" or ""digital music"" attempt to install some form of advertising software in visitors' computers. Once lodged there, spyware can sap a PC's processing power, slow its functioning, and even cause it to crash. The Web is the hottest game in advertising, but what's rarely acknowledged is the extent to which unsavory pop-ups boost the returns. Some advertisers say their messages have appeared in pop-ups without their permission. Others seek out pop-ups, and Direct Revenue frequently sells ads directly to such advertisers."
2006^  The typical Fendi ad is beautifully styled and impeccably shot, but totally static-models toting $2,000 handbags are frozen two-dimensionally on glossy pages. That's all changing in late September when Fendi's first video ad goes live on Style.com, the online home of Vogue and W magazines, just in time for the Italian fashion shows. The video will be peppered across the site, jumping out as a full-screen pop-up and rolling as a 15-second clip before Style.com's videos of the collections. Fendi is just one of a bevy of luxury-goods retailers, including Valentino Fashion Group and Bottega Veneta, that Style.com has recently lured onto the Web. The six-year-old site attracted 88 advertisers to ply next season's swingy spring dresses online during September's New York Fashion Week, a 54% jump over last year. Designers, who rack up $14 billion in sales annually, realize they need to follow the changing habits of customers, who increasingly are snapping up the latest must-haves online.
2006^  The dilemma facing any owner of copyrighted works continues to be how to compete with free given that the unauthorized use of online of books, music, and videos is still rampant. But Mohen's plan is to offer music free and still ensure that the record labels get paid. The concept? Sell advertising and offer music companies the bulk of those revenues. To help woo Madison Avenue, Mohen hired Robin Kent, a former chairman of ad giant Universal McCann Worldwide, to be his CEO, and SpiralFrog was born. SpiralFrog is one of a handful of new services introduced in the past two months that offer music, videos, and, in one case, books for free in exchange for users having to view advertising.
2006^  Move over, MySpace. Just as the big online social networks are branching out, trying to reach an audience broader than teens and Gen Y, a raft of upstarts hopes to reach these same prospects. To attract older or less tech-savvy folks, they're offering ever-more-targeted services that can be personalized to people's existing social groups and interests. These new social-networking sites range from karaoke and photography communities on Multiply to canine sites on Dogster and community TV-style personal video sites and mothers' groups created using do-it-yourself services such as Ning and PeopleAggregator. The big question is whether these sites, which depend largely on advertising for revenues, can overcome the awesome momentum of such leaders as News Corp.'s MySpace, with 130 million users and 8 million more each month, and Facebook, with 12 million people.
2007^  Video producers and would-be stars are pooling their talents and cheap digital cameras to create Wallstrip, a daily show examining top-performing stocks. The timing seems perfect, with pioneering online video series such as Rocketboom and Ask a Ninja drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers and Google Inc. snapping up YouTube for $1.65 billion. Many people are now betting that 2007 will be the year money starts flowing to top indie video creators. what really sets Wallstrip apart is its ambition in the business news arena. Wallstrip creator Howard Lindzon, a small-time hedge fund manager with an eye for Internet startups, is betting that a short, savvy, tongue-in-cheek approach will create a highly profitable niche among twenty- and thirtysomethings turned off by old-school business news. Instead of focusing on price-earnings ratios and the opinions of Wall Street analysts, most episodes of Wallstrip zero in on a single stock that has recently hit its 52-week high.
2007^  Ricky Van Veen is editor-in-chief of CollegeHumor.com, a media play single-mindedly devoted to the (sophomoric) collegiate mind, and he's co-founder of its parent company, Connected Ventures. Last summer, Barry Diller's IAC bought the lion's share of Connected in a deal that valued the company substantially north of $20 million. Despite CollegeHumor's frank raciness, it has helped make ads for its site with some of the biggest brands out there, including Ford and Procter &amp; Gamble. The first ad CollegeHumor made was for a site selling kits enabling consumers to beat drug tests, back around 2001, so the outfit has come a long way. Before its sale, Connected, which also owns clothing company Busted Tees and video-sharing site Vimeo, projected it would gross $10 million in '06.
2007^"  On March 13, Viacom sued YouTube for $1 billion. The Google-owned unit is ""stealing value,"" the complaint alleged, by airing snippets of shows like its Comedy Central hit South Park without paying for the right. Meanwhile, in the other part of Sumner M. Redstone's media empire, we have CBS literally cuddling up to YouTube. If CBS and Viacom have radically different approaches to the world's most popular video service, it's largely because CBS believes it needs YouTube (at least for now) and Viacom believes it doesn't (unless it gets paid). CBS and Viacom both want the same thing: a deal that allows them to leverage YouTube's mass appeal while getting paid. But hammering one out could prove maddeningly difficult. It's no secret that Google/YouTube, despite months of negotiations with a number of parties, has yet to sign a revenue-sharing contract with any major U.S. film or TV studio."
2007^  Give it up for NBC Universal and News Corp., because in late March the two old-media titans made the biggest splash for a nonexistent product since the iPhone. News Corp. and NBC Universal have nothing to show for their ambitious Web video destination site and service (not even a name, so I'll call it NewTube), aside from syndication agreements with Yahoo!, Microsoft's MSN.com, and Time Warner's America Online, along with a fairly detailed business brief. Among other things, NewTube's videos can be embedded on any site, YouTube-style. But unlike YouTube thus far, they'll come with Big Media-approved copyright protection and, at least in some cases, a small share of ad revenues. For media geeks, NewTube (its executives, unsurprisingly, prefer the clunkier handles NewCo or NewSite) is big news. But the venture, expected to launch this summer, is merely one of myriad developments that will remake the world of Web video in the next few months.
2007^  It's Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif., and that means Seth Sternberg, Sandy Jen, and Elaine Wherry have retreated to Fiesta Del Mar to hold their weekly founders' lunch. But this is no ordinary week for the three friends who 21 months ago started Meebo, a new type of instant-messaging service. Just a week from now, on May 15, they're launching a product called Meebo Rooms that could boost them into the big leagues of so-called Web 2.0 companies. With a year or two under their belts, they're trying to move beyond early-adopter audiences and go mainstream. With Meebo Rooms, individuals and media companies create pages around a topic--motorcycling, say, or Bollywood movies. Then visitors can step in to chat and post videos and photos. Like YouTube videos, these rooms also can be posted on other sites and blogs.
2007^  Videos from YouTube and all other streaming media sites on the Web have one big disadvantage: For all but the very tech savvy, it's difficult to download them or take them with you on the road. RealNetworks has the best solution so far. The latest version of RealPlayer, which will be available for free download by the end of June, lets you record any streaming video available on the Web that is not copy-protected and save it for offline viewing. You can even download some of the content to many handheld devices, although this is harder than it ought to be.
2007^  Over the past year, the telecom industry has roared back to life. Credit a steady rise in appetite for broadband Internet connections, which enable easy consumption of watch-my-cat video clips, iPod music files, and such Web-inspired services as free Internet phoning. Indeed, this year broadband adoption among U.S. adults is expected to cross the important threshold of 50%. Capital spending is on the rise as companies invest to build high-speed networks. Private equity players are placing enormous bets on the industry, such as the $8.2 billion that Silver Lake Partners and the Texas Pacific Group agreed to pay for networking gearmaker Avaya on June 5. And the glut in broadband communications capacity is all but gone. About half of the Internet's transmission capacity was going unused in 2002. Today that pipeline has almost doubled in size, and yet the unused portion is down to about 30%. As a result, the price that companies pay for bandwidth in some parts of the U.S. is on the rise after six years of declines.
2007^  As Disney prepares for the August TV debut of High School Musical 2, that other kiddie music juggernaut, Kidz Bop, is pushing beyond its CD genre. Razor &amp; Tie is expanding the brand. Kidz Bop's recently redesigned Web site emphasizes music videos, many made by 6-to-12-year-olds, who upload directly a la YouTube. Traffic quadrupled during the new site's first two weeks, when there were more than 1.3 million video-clip streamings by 400,000 unique users.
2007^  The Archos 605 Wi-Fi video player, on sale Sep 1, 2007, is reviewed. People tend to associate Archos with portable media players, but this silver-and-white model also surfs the Web, downloads content, and docks with a TV. Even novices should find it relatively easy to operate, thanks to intuitive icons on a high-quality 4.3-inch touch screen. The Archos Content Portal, represented by one of those icons, lets you download movies and TV shows from CinemaNow. There's also a music download service called BurnLounge and a link to YouTube, and Archos may announce several other content partnerships. On all models there's a built-in Web browser with Adobe Flash Player support, which improves the hunt for Web content.
2007^  In an echo of the tech bubble, once-iconic Internet analysts Henry Blodget and Mary Meeker are battling it out again over stock valuations. But this little rivalry involves estimates of how much Google can make by overlaying ads on videos viewed at its popular YouTube site.
2007^  Forget the powerful companies that are pouring money into new ways to bring TV into the Internet Age. Some video gamers have figured out their own solution. Using features pre-installed in their game consoles, they call up software from Orb Networks that lets them view Web sites, YouTube videos, or digital music collections on big-screen TVs. Don't try this at home if you aren't a real techie. Orb's controls and setup are plenty complicated.
2007^"  About a month ago, Google caused barely a ripple when it unveiled technology to filter out copyright violations on its YouTube video Web site. After all, YouTube had been under constant fire from big media companies for hosting unauthorized clips. But now a move by AT&amp;T to adopt similar technology across its entire broadband network is raising the hackles of critics. The phone company is in talks with NBC Universal and Walt Disney about embedding a ""content-recognition"" system made by tiny Vobile Inc right into AT&amp;T's Internet transmission apparatus. The technology would be used to guard against illegal distribution of those companies' shows and films. Critics fear that by assigning a phone carrier a gatekeeper role over a broad portion of the Internet--some experts say half of US Net traffic may touch AT&amp;T's network--the system would threaten users' privacy, freedom of speech, and equal access."
2007^"  Fidelity Investments' Web site features a new educational effort, dubbed the Trading Knowledge Center. The advice is solid, the graphics cutting-edge, and the terrific-looking video tutorials deliver sometimes arcane material in easy-to-digest pieces. Each module contains links to well-produced short videos, typically three to four minutes in length. Narrated by professional actors and market experts, they're a cut above most video on the Internet. The advice and explanations run the gamut from the incredibly basic (""options are contracts between a buyer and a seller"") to the nitty-gritty of complex trading strategies (""the classic whipsaw scenario in which a short, sharp price reversal stops you out"")."
2007^  It's the year 2014, and Googlezon, a fearsomely powerful combination of search engine Google Inc. and online store Amazon.com Inc., has crushed traditional media to bits. Taking its place is the computer-generated Evolving Personalized Information Construct--an online package of news, entertainment, blogs, and services drawn from all the world's up-to-the-minute knowledge and customized to match your preferences. And it's all collected, packaged, and controlled by Googlezon. This is the future according to EPIC 2014, a faux documentary posted to the Web in late 2004 by young journalists Matt Thompson and Robin Sloan. Thanks to their slightly tongue-in-cheek, Twilight Zone-inspired tone, the short video drew as many chuckles as gasps of dismay from the legions of mainstream media types and Web digerati who viewed it. Today, nobody's laughing. Here it is only 2007, and already EPIC 2014's picture of an online landscape dominated by one ravenous, all-knowing corporation looks to many people like--well, a lot like Google. All by itself. As the place nearly 400 million people each month start on the Internet, it's the No. 1 gateway to the Net's vast commercial potential.
2007^  Imagine a bookstore that sells only works published by Random House. If you want a HarperCollins title, you have to go to the store down the street. In this world, you're permitted to read Penguin books either on the train or lying in bed, but Vintage books can only be read on the couch. It's absurd--but no more so than the world of video downloads as they exist today. The problem is that the quickly growing stock of movies and shows available for download is scattered among an assortment of stores including Movielink, CinemaNow, Google Video, and Amazon.com Unbox, as well as Apple's iTunes Store. And while there's a lot of overlap, there's also a significant amount of content exclusive to one or another service. This has happened because the digital-download business isn't like any other sort of retailing. It's no wonder none of these download services has developed any real traction in the market.
2007^  Startup download service Jaman aims to become an online film festival for world movies and the works of independent filmmakers - the sort that don't have distribution deals with Miramax Film or Fox Searchlight Pictures. Outside of Jaman, the movies available for download today are mostly a subset of the limited offerings at your local Blockbuster, dominated by films that have recently finished their theatrical runs, box-office hits of the last few years, direct-to-video flops, and just a smattering of classics. Movielink's download service offers fewer than 150 of the thousands of movies made before 1970, plus a shamefully underpowered roster of 40 foreign films. Like nearly all movie download services, Jaman requires its own software player, which is available for both Windows and Mac OS X. The image quality is very good. Jaman's business model is also a step up from other services. As befits a Web startup, Jaman offers an assortment of social networking features.
2007^  The ease of showing video online has led to a deluge of video from nonmedia types everywhere. This year Ford Models began cranking out all manner of Web videos. It's far too early to know if this ends up a short-lived sideline for the 60-year-old modeling agency or becomes another way to make decent money off its picturesque assets, but it's not crazy to think that this nonmedia company may figure out new ways to make Web video work. For one thing, models require little persuading to take star turns on film. Production quality, as you might imagine, is high: Modeling agencies know from flattering angles and lighting. Ford has cut ad-sharing deals with Web partners, and the models in the videos get around 30% of Ford's net.
2007^  Since the beginning of April Comcast, which generates most of its $25 billion a year in revenues by delivering TV over cable, has signed a flurry of deals designed to allow it to do battle with the likes of Yahoo!, MSN, and others that intend to stream TV shows to folks' computers. It struck deals with CBS, Fox, and NBC to deliver their TV shows through Comcast's soon-to-be-launched Fancast online site. It plunked down tens of millions of dollars to buy Fandango, with a notion to turn the online ticketing site into a guide to TV shows available online. For Comcast, this sure looks like a change in strategy. Three years ago it was so hungry to add programming muscle that it was willing to pony up $54 billion to buy Disney. Now it seems desperate to join the Internet party and not be left out of the ad boom surrounding online video. Little wonder: After cable stocks' bullish run last year, investors are more nervous about the industry's prospects these days. Comcast shares are down about $3, to 27, from this year's high.
2007^  By the end of May, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) will report to its member studios the results of tests of a dozen computerized video-fingerprinting systems. This technology is designed to identify pirated movies wherever they exist on the Internet, automating a job that is now done by staffers who look for infringing clips with their own eyes. Fingerprinting systems could be a crucial link in the battle to control video content on the Net.
2007^"  The new Web video service Joost is barely in beta, but it's already subject to inhuman amounts of hype. It's not hard to see why. The service (say ""juiced"") is the next project of Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom, founders of Net phone service Skype. Its investors include Viacom and CBS. The company has just raised $45 million. On a good monitor, its satisfyingly full-screen playback looks gorgeous. Joost's executives singlemindedly stress devotion to full-length programs and their respect for copyrights."
2007^  Since mid-April CBS has inked partnerships with two dozen partners--from Bebo to Veoh--to syndicate its programming online. CBS also passed on taking an equity stake in the still-unnamed Web-video site that NBC Universal and News Corp. are assembling, because that would mean exclusively syndicating shows with the venture. That stake might be huge down the road, concedes CBS CEO Leslie Moonves. But he says the point of CBS's current moves is not to have one big property with an equity upside 10 years from now. All the Web wisdom in the world won't help CBS if the hits dry up. But CBS's moves are coherent philosophically, and about as in tune with how people behave online as one may expect a traditional company to be. Whether its competitors are teeny or titans, CBS can still walk tall.
2007^  In the Web world, widgets are modules of software that people can drag and drop onto the personal page of their social network or onto a blog. There, widgets typically look like a little window or box, packing a bit of the functionality that you would get with a stand-alone Web site or software package. Widgets also can be storefront windows for selling products and services or digital billoards to which customized ads can be affixed. The land grab comes from the sudden realization by software developers, media companies, and retailers that by widgetizing their programs, news snippets, video clips, and products, they can stake out some prime Web real estate. People are increasingly spending their time with like-minded souls at blogs, online communities, and social networking sites. . In a sense, creating widgets is like unleashing a cloud of benign viruses. They carry your storefront or video clip or ad to anyone's Web page or profile. And those who like them can share them with thousands of people. They multiply, and as they do, they alter the very geography of the Web. That leads some technologists to conclude that these humble bits of code - or applications, as widgets are also known - could turbocharge a third phase in the Internet's development. The scramble began on May 24, when Facebook Inc. announced it would crack open its site and hand over significant economic and distribution power to widget developers. Major companies from media, publishing, technology, communications, entertainment, and retail are jumping on the widget bandwagon. Google Inc., the most powerful force on the Web today, is taking widgets seriously. The e-commerce implications are potentially huge. Instead of simply building a destination site where people come to shop, sellers can use widgets to bring the store to the buyers.
2007^  For the last several years, Finnish handset giant Nokia has been on a furious shopping spree. It spent $60 million on a rival to Apple iTunes called Loudeye, the largest independent music distributor on the Net, and followed that up by acquiring navigation software maker gate5 and media-sharing site Twango. Now it's clear what the buying binge was all about. At an Aug 29, 2007 press conference, Nokia unveiled plans to launch a slew of services for mobile users, starting later this year in Europe and Asia. The scheme includes an online music store aimed at the 200 million music-capable Nokia mobile phones already on the market, an interactive multiplayer game service, and a new venue for Nokia handset users to swap photos, videos, and music. It's the most ambitious bid by a phonemaker to spin profits out of content and services.
2007^  There's a reason why Amazon hasn't done much to sell books, movies, or music in digital form, even after acquiring Paris-based Mobipocket in 2005 and unveiling its internally built Unbox movie-download service in 2006. These ventures are still more an investment in the future than a near-term profit engine. Amazon's toe-in-the-water approach may seem odd, considering how it helped pioneer online shopping in the mid-1990s. You might think that fulfilling orders for digital media would be more efficient than pulling CDs off shelves, boxing them, and handing them over to UPS for delivery. But as long as digital music and e-books come with heavy restrictions on how and where consumers can use them, the market will be limited and rights holders will have the power to shake down sellers. For Amazon, there's still much more money to be made shipping real stuff.
2007^  Having shifted much of their advertising budgets from print to online, big consumer-brand companies are increasingly attaching ads to selected words on newspaper and other media Web sites. So-called in-text advertising, purchased by companies such as Ford, Intel, and Microsoft, pops up in small windows when a reader moves a cursor over highlighted, double-underlined words in a story. Pausing over a link produces a bubble containing written pitches, voiceover, or even video. This year the Web sites of several Gannett newspapers, including The Indianapolis Star, The Arizona Republic, and the Reno Gazette-Journal, began using in-text ads. New York City-based Vibrant Media, one of the leading firms that specializes in selling in-text advertising, has nearly doubled the number of publishers showing its ads in the past year. The ongoing shift of ad dollars from print and TV to the Web has increased pressure on publishers to try unconventional formats.
2007^  Online video sites are now scaling back their focus on user-generated clips. What they want now is professionally produced programming. More than 57% of U.S. Internet users say they have watched or downloaded online videos, according to a July study by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project. But they're shunning home videos in favor of news and movie trailers, followed by comedy bits, music videos, and television shows, according to a study by Burst Media. Some advertisers will pay $60-plus per 1,000 views to place their ads inside professional video content, says Suranga Chandratillake of blinkx. Ads on user-generated videos, on the other hand, go for as little as $7 per 1,000 views, says Chandratillake. Meanwhile, Hollywood is flooding the Web with slick new shows, produced specifically for the Net.
2008^"  According to Dave Morgan, founder of ad network Tacoda, the most successful ad format for Web video sites has been display ads that run near video clips. Like all big online players, Google has invested serious time and dollars (the $3.1 billion DoubleClick deal, for instance) in beefing up its display-ad capabilities. YouTubers point out that most of their key ad formats - including the ""overlay"" format, which places an ad over a small portion of a video without interrupting it - have been available only since August. At ad agencies, Web video ads can be subject to tug-of-wars and turf battles between TV buyers and digital buyers. YouTube is holding contests in which users upload videos to a sponsor's page and thus, ideally, generate heat and page views for ad messages."
2008^  The latest tech darling has arrived, and it goes by the name of FriendFeed. Silicon Valley is buzzing about the seven-month-old startup, which offers a promising if somewhat messy new Internet service. Part of the interest comes from the blue-ribbon pedigrees of its founders, including Google alums Paul Buchheit and Bret Taylor, who honchoed Gmail and Google Maps. But just as much of the hullabaloo stems from how the founders are addressing a growing issue online: the balkanization of the Web. People are socializing on networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace and sharing pictures and videos on Web sites including Flickr and YouTube. But all these activities have been walled off from one another, like separate digital worlds. To keep track of friends and colleagues, you have to log in and out of different services constantly. FriendFeed is one of the first major efforts to break down these walls. With the startup's service, subscribers can pull together on one Web page everything their friends and colleagues are doing on more than 30 Web sites.
2008^  No fewer than six manufacturers of high-definition televisions, including Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic, Sony, and Samsung, are introducing sets this year that stay permanently connected to your home broadband network and fetch everything from sports scores and weather to videos, movies, and photos you've stored online. With all this content finally coming to the big screen in the living room, why ever leave home? Blockbuster still has a ton of movie offerings that aren't available anywhere on the Net. And people who want everything on one screen can use any number of stand-alone devices, such as Apple TV, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Plug one of these, or almost any laptop, into an ordinary digital TV and you'll be able to browse YouTube or access movie stores. The difference is, the new TV sets make the process easier and cheaper.
2008^  Nearly a year ago, NBC Universal and News Corp. launched a video site called Hulu. The Web cognoscenti scoffed at two Old Media dinosaurs taking on YouTube. But the derision has abated of late. Thanks to a huge library, Hulu is attracting millions of viewers and signing up advertisers like Bank of America, Best Buy, and Nissan. In effect, NBCU and News Corp. gambled that people are willing to watch full-length TV shows and movies online. In the Age of YouTube, that's a contrarian position. The Web video king has become ubiquitous with clips rarely more than five minutes long. YIn effect, NBCU and News Corp. gambled that people are willing to watch full-length TV shows and movies online. In the Age of YouTube, that's a contrarian position. The Web video king has become ubiquitous with clips rarely more than five minutes long. Hulu did something else unusual. Rather than forcing people to come to its site, it cut deals with portals like AOL, Comcast, MSN, and Yahoo! to show Hulu-branded video on their sites.
2008^  MTV Networks (MTVN) operates more than 5,000 mobile, console, and online games and virtual worlds - many of them based on TV shows such as MTV's The Real World and Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. MTVN has even cut a deal to develop new titles with Hollywood uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer of CSI and Armaggedon fame. And this isn't just about kids. The network is keen to hook the growing ranks of so-called casual gamers, including women old enough to have a couple of teenagers in the house. Total time spent gaming online hit 11.4 billion minutes in December, up 27% over the previous year, according to Web-traffic tracker comScore. Only e-mail and shopping keep people online longer nowadays. MTVN started to ratchet up its game strategy three years ago with a series of acquisitions. The company has plowed $800 million into properties that appeal to a range of ages. MTVN doesn't break out its gaming ad revenues but says it has signed up dozens of advertisers. MTVN has been putting product placements in its TV shows for years. Now it's doing the same thing online.
2008^"  Frustrated by the usual fix-it options - obediently waiting on hold with Bangalore, gamely chatting online with a scripted robot - more consumers are rebelling against company-prescribed service channels. After getting nowhere with the call center, these consumer vigilantes are sending ""e-mail carpet bombs"" to the C-suite, cc-ing the top layer of management with their complaints. When all else fails, a plucky few are going straight to the top after uncovering direct numbers to executive customer-service teams not easily found by mere mortals. And of course, they're filling up the Web with blogs and videos, leaving behind venom-spewed tales of woe. Behind the guerrilla tactics is a growing disconnect between the experience companies promise and customers' perceptions of what they actually get. Consumers already pushed to the brink by evaporating home equity, job insecurity, and rising prices are more apt to snap when hit with long hold times and impenetrable phone trees. A swell of corporate distrust - exacerbated by high executive pay, accounting lapses, and the offshoring of jobs - has people feeling more at odds with companies than ever before. Technology is aiding the uprising, empowering consumers to do much more to make themselves heard. Add a powerful media voice and a provocative site title to a blog, and it can have extraordinary impact. The biggest challenges in customer service may be dealing with consumers who are hard to mollify. For some, the sting of a bad experience cuts so deep that it transforms them from a merely upset customer into an activist no longer just looking for a refund. A recent study by market research firm Yankelovich finds that more than half of American adults think they know more about the products and services they shop for than the people helping them in the stores."
2008^  It's April, and Microsoft's top U. S. salesman for online advertising, Keith Lorizio, is visiting clients in New York City. In a midtown office tower, he sits down with Nicholas Utton, the gregarious chief marketing officer at online broker E*Trade. Utton is plenty impressed with Microsoft's technology, and he's a big advertiser on the company's MSN Money site. But when it comes to Internet search sites, the largest and most lucrative advertising market online, Utton makes it clear that Microsoft is, as he sees it, way behind front-runner Google. They're not getting much of our search dollars, he says. Lorizio's pitch just got even tougher. On May 3, Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer withdrew his offer for Web giant Yahoo!, the No. 2 power in online ads, after the two sides failed to agree on a price. Ballmer had said that the proposed acquisition, which valued Yahoo at $47.5 billion, was the best way for Microsoft to gain the scale necessary to compete against Google for online advertising dollars. Now, after three months of talks, it looks as though Microsoft and Yahoo will be left trying to catch Google on their own, at least for now. It may be impossible to catch Google in search advertising. But Microsoft has a fighting chance on several other fronts. Perhaps most important is display advertising, the colorful banner and video ads that run at the top or along the side of Web pages.
2009^"  The main backers of the long-awaited music site, Vevo, which was launched December 8th (Universal Music, Sony Music Entertainment, and EMI Group) hope Vevo will help turn around the sagging recording industry. For years record labels saw music videos as just another tool to sell CDs. Now, with album sales down more than 52% since their peak in 2000, the industry sees videos as a potential advertising gold mine--or at least a silver mine. Vevo's goal, says CEO Rio Caraeff, is to ""enhance"" music fans' experience by providing a central location for premium quality videos as well as bonus materials about the artists and their songs. Vevo, which has its own YouTube channel, is the music industry's version of Hulu, the TV and movie site operated by NBC, Fox, and ABC. Of course, Hulu isn't making money, though there are differences between the models. Some 20 advertisers signed on for Vevo's launch. Warner has a different approach. It believes Vevo's portal-like service diminishes the only brands that matter in music: the artists."
2009^  The two thirtyish founders of Web video production company EQAL, Miles Beckett and Greg Goodfried, are too media-savvy to boast they've cracked the code for minting big hits from serialized short online videos. Nevertheless, this is what their business (say equal) is based on, and it's why CBS is paying them to create a Web series offshoot of the network's upcoming mystery show Harper's Island. Goodfried and Beckett envision four ways for EQAL to make a buck: original online series that generate ad and sponsorship deals; doing work-for-hire for the likes of CBS; licensing its series abroad; and providing its tech platforms for videobloggers who've scored success on YouTube and want to start their own sites. Those ancillary streams are now important, Goodfried concedes, since selling ads and sponsorships around EQAL's original work just got tougher: What we do is the R&amp;D side of marketing, and everyone is cutting that in the short term.
2009^  For all its success selling text ads alongside search results, Google can't seem to make a go of it anywhere else in the ad world. In its hunt for new growth, the search giant is redoubling efforts to grab a bigger piece of the largest online ad market it doesn't control: display ads, the pictorial banners and videos that account for more than a third of the $40 billion online ad market. Google faces a tough challenge. Yahoo! and Microsoft's MSN have a huge lead in display ads, largely because they can put ads on their own pages of content, like Yahoo Finance and MSN Money. Google hopes to place more display ads on its YouTube site as well as on thousands of partner sites, from small blogs to The New York Times. Google will begin demonstrating what may be its most potent weapon in this emerging battle: an overhauled version of the advertising exchange that it picked up in the $3.2 billion acquisition of DoubleClick. The exchange is part of Google's overriding goal to make display ads, which can be expensive to create and complex to manage, so easy that even the smallest businesses can use them. Still, the exchange won't be an instant game-changer. Since exchanges require a new mindset at agencies and publishers, they may take time to catch on widely, says Mike Walrath, founder of Yahoo's Right Media exchange. And some think anything but search gets short shrift inside Google.
2009^  The thing about Web video, of course, is that anyone can do it. Shoot it, edit it, distribute it on YouTube and other outlets--done. Assuming, of course, that distribute means put it alongside zillions of similar things. This is partly why building a Web video business is tough, as even showbiz vets have discovered. Unless you invert aspects of the traditional model, as a two-year-old Santa Monica (Calif.) Web video outfit called Deca does. Deca, an acronym for Digital Entertainment Corp. of America, is exploring several ways to produce Web series in unusually marketer-centric ways.
2009^  Hulu was launched in 2007. Each month the site's 1,700-title catalog of TV shows and movies attracts nearly 40 million viewers--people who will endure a couple of commercials per sitcom (vs. eight or more on TV) in exchange for the luxury of being able to watch a show for free, just one day after it airs on network TV. Those days may now be coming to an end. NBC, Fox, and ABC, the broadcasters that control Hulu, are warming to the idea of charging for at least some content. Hulu is expected to start testing subscription tiers for its programs in the new year, according to those who have worked with the Los Angeles company. The site may be No. 2 after YouTube in number of videos streamed, according to comScore, but analysts expect Hulu to lose $33 million this year. The betting among analysts is that sooner or later Hulu will ditch its open model in favor of a closed one.
2009^  On Feb. 3, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is going to make an honest man of me. Finally I will be able to buy a legal DVD of one of my favorite movies, Carol Reed's 1959 Our Man in Havana. But there's still no rhyme or reason to what films are available in any digital form. If, for example, you happen to have a videotape player around, you can watch an old VHS version of The African Queen. But you can't buy it on DVD or download it from any of the Hollywood-sanctioned online services. The basic problem is that Hollywood is attempting to preserve an analog business model in a digital age.
2009^  Maximum Entertainment, a production company that makes video ads. Maximum's pitch, to marketers and ad agencies that might be interested in hiring it, revolves around the company's stable of directors, almost all of whom come from the world of film. The Internet continues to rework most long-held assumptions about media and marketing, but many advertisers, rightly or wrongly, still spend serious sums to ensure they get beautiful images. There are ego issues associated with hiring famous directors - all marketers think their products are stars - but the real dividends come from unusually memorable ads. Maximum's trump card is its knack for attracting well-known directors who are new to shooting ads. In its most idealized form, a company like Maximum solves two problems. It produces commercials for recession-battered advertising agencies that have cut back on in-house production. And it provides revenue to directors who make the sort of small movies that are cherished by the cognoscenti but rarely do boffo box office. The likes of Maximum represent one more way in which the decay of older business models spreads out monies, and opportunities, to new-style players.
2009^  Thanks to the Web, companies have direct online access to consumers. Take that fact, stir in the surfeit of unemployed journalists (or fearful employed ones searching for safer perches), and you get novel kinds of businesses forming around news and media professionals. Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based company that sells anti-virus software, launched Threatpost.com on Mar. 11. The site, which focuses on computer and Internet security, aggregates articles and videos from across the Web. It employs two journalists to blog, edit the site, and produce its podcasts. Moving into media is an odd step given the wholesale carnage afflicting all sectors of that industry these days. But privately held Kaspersky is not after a media business. It's not selling ads on the site, though it may run promotions for business partners. Threatpost, says Kaspersky's chief marketing officer, Randy Drawas, is not a profit-generating enterprise. Rather, the company wants in on the public discourse concerning the issues its business revolves around. To sidestep concerns about favoritism, we draw the line at product news and reviews, says its editor Ryan Naraine, a tech journalist hired by Kaspersky in May 2008 as a public-relations staffer.
2009^"  The ""real-time Web"" is the term coined to describe the exploding number of live social activities online, from tweets to status updates on Facebook to the sharing of news, Web links, and videos on myriad other sites. It's also a whole new field of dreams for entrepreneurs and investors. Amid the downsized remains of Web 2.0, with online advertising and e-commerce in a drought, they're viewing the real-time Web as the Internet's Next Big Thing. The emerging sector is so new, and its boundaries so fuzzy, that it's difficult to know how much money has been sunk into how many firms. But many dozens of startups are staking claims and drawing interest from investors. ""Real-time"" is actually a bit of a misnomer. Most of this activity doesn't truly occur in real time, the way talking on the phone does, and social gestures such as sharing links with friends are just as important a part of the appeal as immediacy. These gestures--often accompanied by data from people's profiles on social networks, such as where they live or their age--hold the key to the real-time Web's moneymaking potential. Established search engines have no intention of falling behind."
2010^  Earlier this summer the Web analytics company TubeMogul released a study estimating that the top indie video producers on YouTube earn north of $100,000 in annual advertising revenue alone. Although the video-sharing site may not be minting millionaire entertainers yet, six-figure incomes are within reach for the most industrious creators. So far in 2010, Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal, the 32-year-old comedians known professionally as Rhett &amp; Link, videos have averaged 119,457 views per day, according to TubeMogul. What really sets them apart -- lots of YouTube celebrities have more daily views -- is their leadership in doing branded integration, says David Burch of TubeMogul. By branded integration, Burch means sponsorships. For most, the YouTube partner program does not provide enough to survive on. So video makers hustle on multiple fronts: They sell T-shirts and mugs to fans on their YouTube pages. Musicians use videos to sell songs on iTunes and tickets for live gigs.
2010^  Google has long been criticized for relying too heavily on one source of revenue, but it may soon have its first billion-dollar business outside of search advertising. Analysts predict revenues from the company's display advertising business will rise as much as 40% this year, to slightly more than $1 billion. Most of that business will come from selling video and banner ads on YouTube, which Google acquired in 2005.
2010^  Ever since a mid-level engineer at Apple left a prototype iPhone in a Silicon Valley bar on April 18, the tech world has been consumed with the ensuing drama. Apple wouldn't comment for this story, and there's no way of knowing whether the prototype will ever get to market. Yet the device has generated excitement about mobile video communications. Expect a wave of new video-communication technology by Christmas. Skype, based in Luxembourg, plans to introduce a version of its online video-chat service for cell phones. Logitech general manager Eric Kintz says his company will introduce a cell-phone version of its Vid videoconferencing service by the end of the year. Meanwhile, an obstacle to consumer acceptance of earlier generations of videophones was the thought of being seen in a bathrobe or without makeup. And the current generation of Twittering, YouTube-ing over-sharers has fewer privacy concerns.
2010^  On June 30, 2010 the Homeland Security Dept.'s US Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement arm used a vacant sound stage at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, CA, to announce the seizure of nine Web sites with names like NinjaVideo.net and thepiratecity.org that allegedly traffic in illegal movie downloads. Hollywood may also get a big win in the pending financial reform legislation that will reshape the regulation of derivatives. Hollywood's biggest win so far has been on movie piracy. Major movie studios and the industry's lobbying group have been generous Democratic Party campaign contributors. Hollywood still has big policy priorities on its agenda. Major movie studios were disappointed by a federal court decision on June 24, 2010 that sided with Google in a lawsuit filed by Viacom alleging that Google's video-sharing Web site, YouTube, did not act quickly enough to take down copyright-infringing content.
2010^"  On the Internet, everyone can hear you scream - including your boss. When 25-year-old Brian Maupin posted a goofy cartoon to YouTube about an interaction between an imbecilic, iPhone-lusting customer and a salesman at an imaginary ""Phone Mart,"" he just wanted to make people laugh - and vent frustration from his job selling mobile gear at a Best Buy in Independence, Mo. Maupin posted the video on June 24, 2010. On July 2, 2010, Best Buy told Maupin that the videos disparaged the company and some products it sells. They asked him to take down the videos; he removed the two that mentioned Best Buy, leaving up the EVO-vs.-iPhone parodies. Maupin was suspended, and a store manager told him he would probably lose his job. Best Buy's negative reaction to a viral video created by an employee may help jump-start the cartoon maker's graphic arts career."
2010^  Bob Iger, the CEO of Walt Disney, wants to acquire social games and other online services that come with established customers and talented creators - and can help sell Disney's famous brands. Since paying $350 million for the kids' social network Club Penguin, Disney has purchased Wideload Games, whose founder helped create Microsoft's hit Halo franchise. The entertainment giant acquired Tapulous, a publisher of music-related games for Apple's iPhone. On Jul 27, 2010, Disney made its biggest video game bet yet, agreeing to pay $563 million for privately held Playdom, the Mountain View, CA maker of Sorority Life and Mobsters, which are played on Facebook, MySpace, and mobile phones. If Playdom meets performance targets over time, its founders and investors may receive an additional $200 million. Iger says the buy-don't-build approach is what drove some earlier acquisitions.
2010^"  Cities and towns across the country, hungry for better broadband, are trying to grab Google's attention. The Mountain View company said last month it's planning a new Internet service of 1 gigabit per second, or about 20 times faster than the speediest offering from Verizon Communications. Richard Whitt, Google's Washington telecom and media counsel, says the company may spend ""hundreds of millions"" on the effort, which will involve stringing fiber-optic lines into homes in a small number of cities. If American Net service gets faster, people will likely spend more time watching videos or playing games online, providing Google fresh ways to expand its advertising business."
2010^  Amanda Dorsey, a 28-year-old unemployed writer and editor in Florida, is one of about 100,000 people in CrowdFlower's on-demand workforce who have taken pay in virtual rather than real dollars, says CEO Lukas Biewald, who also pays with the real stuff. Virtual cash can be used to buy seeds or weapons to play FarmVille, Mafia Wars, or other popular games on social media sites like Facebook. Players accumulate virtual money by earning points within a game or by converting real dollars into pretend currency. CrowdFlower pays to place help-wanted ads within such games as FarmVille, created by Zynga. People who answer the ads with companies that have online tasks to dole out are then placed by CrowdFlower, which gets compensated by those companies in real, green money. CrowdFlower pays on a per-task basis, at a rate set by the companies that hire it to find workers.
2010^  Akamai Technologies is the leader in the booming business of helping Web sites stream content. Researcher comScore estimates that people watched 35.7 billion online videos in June in the US, up from 19.5 billion a year earlier. Akamai was the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year up to Jul 28, climbing 74%. That is when investors did a U-turn, sending Akamai down by 13% over two days. The causes of the drop are Moore's Law -- the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months, making computers cheaper and more powerful over time -- and competition. Paul Sagan, Akamai's CEO, says price wars do not mean commoditization. The most promising area of growth, Sagan says, may be high-definition video, which has just started arriving on PCs.
2010^  On Sep 14, Twitter unveiled a redesign of its home page. The new look displays photos, videos, maps, and other extras in the stream of content. Users raved: A scan of Twitter updates about the redesign revealed mostly glowing comments about the new features. A whole ecosystem of companies has sprung up around the service, which allows its 145 million users to send 140-character messages, or tweets. Although the number of companies building third-party applications has grown large, the vast majority of them still generate little revenue. Twitter's recent moves have outside developers worried that a bigger, better Twitter will mean fewer opportunities for them. One reason for the worry among developers and investors is that Twitter does not do a good enough job of broadcasting its intentions. CEO Evan Williams says the redesigned home page will boost the number of Twitter users, which will be good for its partners.
2010^  It might be called the PlayBook, but the new tablet computer from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) is all about business. The device, introduced by co-CEO Mike Lazaridis in San Francisco on Sep 27, will go head-to-head with Apple's iPad. The PlayBook boasts several features the iPad lacks, including front- and rear-facing cameras for teleconferencing and the ability to play online videos made with Adobe's Flash technology. It is also smaller and lighter, and comes with the same security features that made the BlackBerry popular with governments and corporations. RIM has yet to announce prices and says the first version of the device will access the Web from a Wi-Fi hotspot or by wirelessly connecting through a BlackBerry via Bluetooth technology.
2010^  The new Apple TV has been shrunk to a quarter of its former size, the price has been slashed from $229 to $99, and, most important, it no longer includes a hard disk to store video. Apple TV is now built around its ability to use your home Wi-Fi network to stream high-definition movies and shows, photos, and music -- from online sources or your computer -- to your television. Apple TV's 720p-quality video provides a consistently crisp, smooth picture, with none of the stuttering that sometimes mars streamed content. The one blemish was that the device occasionally grossly overstated how long it would take to begin watching a movie after selecting it. Apple TV may turn out to be a Trojan Horse -- a deceptively simple gadget that, once in the home, expands its functionality until it takes control of everything.
2010^  As a senior research scientist with Adobe Systems' Photoshop Group, Todor Georgiev is experimenting with plenoptic lenses. His plenoptic lens is actually an array of thousands of micro-lenses carved into a silicon wafer. With one shutter click, it captures thousands of variations -- different exposures or depths of field, for instance -- of the same image. Working with Andrew Lumsdaine, a computer scientist at Indiana University, he has built specialized software to interpret plenoptic photos and enable after-the-fact alterations. In an online video demonstrating the technology, Georgiev projects a picture of a field with a young girl in the foreground and beehives off in the distance. It is a stepping-stone on the way to Georgiev's goal of designing a camera that can capture all available optical data with a single click of the shutter.
2010^  For more than a decade, a public-service television campaign from the UK's Transport Department has relied on cartoon hedgehogs to teach street safety to kids aged nine to 13, the group of pedestrians most likely to be killed or injured by autos. In 2007, the British government turned to Kati London, a producer at game-design studio Area/Code in New York City. For the UK, London and her team built a game called Code of Everand, which launched in 2009. Everand's 170,000 users play as Pathfinders navigating a dangerous fantasy world. The game is filled with subtle cues to encourage street safety. The government has commissioned an independent evaluation of the game's impact that is due in spring 2011.
2010^  Zynga's latest title, CityVille, is scheduled to begin its rollout at 6 P.M. Pacific on Nov 17. Privately held Zynga helped define online social games, the programs played by hundreds of millions of users with their friends on Facebook and other social networks. With social games on track to become a $2.2 billion industry by 2012, according to ThinkEquity analyst Atul Bagga, and contenders like Walt Disney and Electronic Arts buying their way into the business through acquisitions over the past year, the pressure is on to make CityVille the new addiction for online gamers. CityVille borrows heavily from SimCity, the classic urban simulation game. Users pave roads and lay railroad tracks to create virtual towns; residents are little computer-controlled characters that walk and drive to and fro. The goal is to increase the population of the town by building more and more sophisticated industries: Small shops become retail empires, villages become metropolises.
2010^"  The Logitech Revue, the new Google TV gadget, is a set-top box for those who do not mind stumbling over an occasional ""page not found"" message on their big-screen television or changing channels with a keyboard. The $299 Revue's remote control is a full-sized wireless keyboard. Google TV is a software that provides a single interface to the video universe and locates shows whether they originate with a cable or satellite provider, paid online services, or free sites. Besides the Revue, Google TV is built into a line of Sony TV models and one of its Blu-ray players. The idea behind Google TV is a good one. The problem is that the world of video is a wild and woolly place, and Google TV falls short of being able to tame it."
2011^  Founded in 2009, Kickstarter is an online fundraising platform for creative projects. Musicians, designers, filmmakers, and other artists craft a short pitch, usually a video, post it on the site, and set a fundraising target and a time frame. If the project meets its goal, Kickstarter, a for-profit company, takes a 5% cut and the creator gets the rest. Kickstarter has emerged as a legitimate option for financing independent films, where a six-figure project is on the low end. So far, the company has raised more than $21 million from nearly 240,000 backers for 2,443 films, according to co-founder Yancey Strickler. He says six films have crossed the $100,000 mark. Independence is one of Kickstarter's main advantages over the typical filmmaker fundraising road show.
2011^  In 2006, Adam Beguelin sold his startup, a video-search site called Truveo, to AOL for $50 million. Then he decided to pack up his family and move to Vietnam for a year of kite-surfing and cultural exploration. He is now back in the US and working on Sensr.net, a site that makes it easy to view, share, and store video feeds from network cameras, which connect to the Internet without need for a PC. Sensr monitors video from such cameras using any Internet-connected device. The site stores an unlimited amount of low-quality video and for a small monthly fee will start keeping high-definition feeds later this year. Beguelin says his service, which will also make it easy to share videos on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, is about socializing these devices.
2011^  Deborah Lloyd, creative director of Kate Spade New York, has turned around Kate Spade by infusing it with her own quirky sensibility. A brand once best known for minimalist, angular handbags coveted by 40-year-old suburban moms today has a hipper take aimed at urban professionals between the ages of 26 and 36. Sales have doubled to $185 million since Lloyd arrived three years ago, helping make Kate Spade the best performer of Liz Claiborne's collection of brands. Lloyd and Craig Leavitt, the company's chief executive officer, devised a strategy that included bringing out more collections each year and expanding overseas, especially in China and Japan. Lloyd and Leavitt have boosted marketing to a younger crowd with the requisite Facebook page, Twitter feed, and YouTube videos.
2011^"  Even in the present era of 10,000 niches, mass customization, and the ""long tail"" -- of companies selling fewer items from a far vaster inventory -- people are, arguably, governed more than ever by what's popular. Thanks to the Internet's ability to rank everything, one can dwell almost exclusively in the world of trending Twitter topics, of top-reviewed restaurants, of Amazon.com bestselling books, of the cutest cute-cat YouTube videos. News sites all feature tallies of the Most Read, Most E-mailed, and Most Commented On articles -- creating a self-reinforcing conversation. This article presents the results of a survey on persons, products, or trends that experienced the greatest commercial growth or surge in popularity during 2010, or between last year and this one. The entries are plotted based on a relevant number along a scale beginning at zero and running to 14,594,874,110,347."
2011^  Where's My Water?, the new mobile game from Walt Disney, stars Swampy, an alligator who lives in an underground sewer. Players swipe their fingers across an iPhone screen to guide water into his tub while dodging toxic sludge and collecting rubber duckies as prizes. With the 99 cents app, also available for the iPad, the House of Mickey is attempting to do something it has never done before: spin a multimillion-dollar franchise out of a character that made his debut on a 3.5-inch screen. Disney already has Swampy's career plotted out. A 12-episode animated series will air on Disney.com and on YouTube sometime in the first quarter of 2012, part of a recent deal that will have the two companies spend as much as $15 million on co-branded content.
2011^"  Using a palm-size MicroConsole adapter hooked up to the television and home network, a person can play ""in the cloud"" over the Internet, with the games actually running on powerful servers that might be 1,000 miles away. OnLive has the potential to be disruptive, maybe even revolutionary, technology. The $99 adapter plugs into a high-definition port in the television, and comes with a wireless handheld controller and one game. The system does not work over Wi-Fi, so a hardwired Internet connection is required. Hard-core gamers debate whether OnLive's response times are fast enough and whether graphics look as good as they do on a dedicated console. Because OnLive is a service and not just hardware, it offers some cool additional features."
2011^  Online ads have been around since the dawn of the Web, but only in recent years have they become the rapturous life dream of Silicon Valley. Arriving on the heels of Facebook have been blockbusters such as the game maker Zynga and coupon peddler Groupon. Once again, 11 years after the dot-com-era peak of the Nasdaq, Silicon Valley is reaching the saturation point with business plans that hinge on crossed fingers as much as anything else. There's always someone out there crying bubble, it seems; the trick is figuring out when it's easy money -- and when it's a shell game. No one is suggesting that the top tier of ad-centric companies is going down should the bubble pop. As for the next tier or two down, where a profusion of startups is piling into every possible niche involving social networking and ads -- the fate of those companies is anybody's guess.
2011^  Math was something Salman Khan understood. It was one of his majors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with computer science and electrical engineering. He is now a quasi-religious figure in a country desperate for a math Moses. His free Web site, dubbed the Khan Academy, may well be the most popular educational site in the world. He has posted more than 2,300 videos, beginning with simple addition and going all the way to subjects such as Green's theorem, normally found in a college calculus syllabus. His program has also spread from the homes of online learners to classrooms around the world, to the point that, in at least a few classrooms, it has supplanted textbooks. Khan is more than just popular. He is a darling of America's amateur educational elite who write checks and invite him to speak at their functions. Many of his followers are tech leaders, who understand more than most how dire America's standing in math education has become and what it may mean.
2011^  This year, Canoe Ventures, the $150 million effort launched by Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Charter Communications, Cablevision Systems, and Bright House Networks, finished building a platform that allows advertisers to include interactive elements in commercials -- with Canoe collecting a fee for each ad campaign sold. There's just one problem: The Web got there first. Even if interactivity fails, Canoe has a back-up plan: video-on-demand. In the past 12 months, television viewers have streamed 8 billion videos on demand in the US, says researcher SNL Kagan. Each of these streams can be embedded with so-called dynamic advertising, commercials that can be updated and refreshed over time. Canoe CEO Kathy Timko, who acknowledges the cable companies that bankrolled Canoe want to see results, is hopeful the interactive spots now starting to run on cable networks AMC, E!, and Style Network will draw more advertisers to the technology.
2011^  ReCaptcha still provides more than half of the 280 million captchas solved each day and has had to steadily ratchet up the difficulty. People have really seen the step-up in difficulty, says Tyler Paxton, a University of Michigan business school graduate and part of a recent wave of entrepreneurs who think they have a better alternative. The solution dreamt up by Paxton and his business school friends Reid Tatoris and Benjamin Blackmer: Mini-games. Their startup, aptly named Are You a Human, has created 10 simple games that, they say, are easy for humans to solve but almost impossible for computers. Are You a Human plans to make money by charging advertisers or Web sites to design games that integrate their brands, starting at about $25 per 1,000 games played.
2012^  In an interview, Hulu CEO Jason Kilar talks about the future of online video. Kilar says the Internet is going to have a bigger impact on content creators than the television ever had. He adds that the reason why that's the case is that suddenly people are able to tell stories 24/7 in the home, out of the home, in every room of the home. Kilar also says that the pay television industry today is a very healthy business. People pay for Netflix, HBO, VUDU, and Hulu Plus. He adds that the only thing that differentiates all those services is what people get in return for a given price. Meanwhile, Kilar says that Hulu launched its first original scripted series, called Battleground. He adds that they thought it was a story that needed to be told, and it would be a great differentiation for a service like Hulu.
2012^"  Late last year, Google's YouTube announced it would spend $100 million to support video programming. YouTube is funding filmmakers, artists, writers, and proven online hitmakers with grants that range from a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars. It will eventually have about 100 new channels, including the Chopra Well, which will feature 10 spirituality-themed shows. By building a library of professionally produced programming that is closer to Charlie's Angels than to ""Charlie Bit My Finger,"" Google hopes to attract more viewers, reduce the need to negotiate with Hollywood studios, and woo some of the big-name advertisers who have been reluctant to put their products next to cat videos. YouTube is betting there's an entire class of material that might languish on cable but will find an audience on the Web. Others in the online ad world aren't so sure big brands can get comfortable with this kind of consumer control, despite YouTube's push into premium programming."
2012^  Not long ago, like many YouTube entertainers, the comedians Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal juggled lots of duties. They were part of the elite group of performers who could generate six-figure annual incomes via YouTube's revenue-sharing program, and by selling merchandise and creating sponsored video ads for consumer brands. Now Rhett &amp; Link have joined a growing crew of indie YouTube stars who have signed on to be represented by the Collective, a newfangled media company based in Los Angeles. The company aims to capitalize on the shifting entertainment landscape, in part, says entertainment veteran Michael Green, by teaming with artists like Rhett &amp; Link, who he believes are well positioned to capitalize on the decentralization of media consumption. Brand spending in digital video has ballooned, growing from $324 million in 2007 to $1.8 billion in 2011, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. The Collective's artists have benefited.
2012^  Los Angeles startup Therapick.com is shooting video interviews with licensed psychotherapists and compiling an online directory of short profile clips. People can use the site to look up psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, and clinical social workers by Zip Code and specialty, then watch their videos before deciding whether to schedule a session. So far, Therapick has taped interviews with more than 500 therapists in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and seven other cities. Therapists pay $299 a year to put the videos on Therapick's site, accompanied by text descriptions of their backgrounds and specialties. They can also embed the spots on their own Web sites or put them on YouTube.
2012^"  Kids have been daring each other to do stupid stuff since the beginning of time, but only recently have social media come along to enhance -- and help share -- the experience. A recent craze sweeping teen circles is the Cinnamon Challenge. The goal is to gobble up a teaspoon of cinnamon and swallow it all in 60 seconds. The fun part comes from capturing it all on a laptop or phone and putting it on YouTube or Facebook, where friends and strangers can watch and revel in your pain. Where content is free, an entrepreneur is usually trying to make money off of it, and that person has emerged in the form of Scott Rosenbaum, who is seeking to monetize the orange ""dragon breath,"" as he calls it, often emitted by challengers. Rosenbaum is the proprietor of Cinnamonchallenge.com."
2012^  Boxee, an Internet video provider, is embroiled in a spat with Comcast, News Corp, and Walt Disney, companies that own cable channels and are much more fluent in the language of Washington. The entertainment heavyweights are among those backing a rule the FCC proposed that would allow cable operators to encrypt all their television transmissions. That would be a blow to Boxee, which allows cable subscribers to plug their cords directly into Boxee Boxes -- bypassing the cable companies' own set-top boxes, and giving expensive dramas like Mad Men equal billing with YouTube's dog-on-skateboard videos. Taking a page from the Internet industry's recent defeat of the media industry-backed Stop Online Piracy Act, Boxee has rallied some of its two million users through blogs and social networks, asking them to voice their opposition to the FCC rule.
2012^  With all the hoopla surrounding YouTube's new channels and ad initiative, business owners may be left wondering how to raise their profile on the site. One small company that has made a pretty big splash is Pigtronix, a guitar effects-pedal maker headquartered in Port Jefferson, NY, a town on Long Island about 60 miles east of Manhattan's Upper West Side, where YouTube unveiled scores of new channels to ad executives on Wednesday evening. YouTube is a core part of its marketing strategy, Pigtronix co-founder Dave Koltai told as he demonstrated his pedals on Tuesday afternoon. Over the years the company's video strategy has morphed, Koltai says. While he initially thought product demos would be the way to go he has since realized that music will get people coming back, especially if it's a big name who's doing the playing.
2012^  It's all the rage to predict the demise of online display ads and Yahoo!, the company that pioneered the business. Display advertising is the old man of online marketing -- Web site banners are much less fashionable than, say, a personalized coupon delivered to your smartphone. The issue isn't the viability of display ads but whether Yahoo can stay in the game. From 2009 to 2011, the company's share of the market fell from 15.4% to 10.8%, according to EMarketer. The drop was largely due to the growth of Facebook and Google's YouTube. Yahoo is chasing buyers in online video, the fastest-growing category of Web ads, says EMarketer, which estimates the format will grow by 38% annually through 2015.
2012^  While touring with his rock band Fiction Plane in 2010, bass player and vocalist Joe Sumner woke up one morning to discover 450 videos on YouTube of the previous night's show in Lithuania. Uploaded by fans with mobile phones, the footage was mostly grainy, shot from awkward angles, and had horrible sound. But it gave Sumner an idea of linking all of these videos and make a compelling movie. Vyclone, a company Sumner founded two years ago with friend David King Lassman, attempts to realize this vision. Its free program debuted in Apple's App Store on Jul 18 and lets two or more people in close proximity shoot video with their iPhones, upload the clips, and view a movie automatically spliced together from different angles.
2012^  At less than $3, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia shares are worth a mere 8% of the $40 they hit after she took it public in 1999, serving orange juice and brioche to New York Stock Exchange traders. Rather than pack up her cookbooks and craft bags and head home to Connecticut or the Hamptons, America's most famous homemaker Martha Stewart is remaking her brand into one focused heavily on the Internet. On Sep 10, the company announced new partnerships to extend its content online, including a Martha Stewart Network with programs featuring Martha and chef Emeril Lagasse on video-streaming services Hulu and Hulu Plus, a deal to distribute shorter video clips on the AOL On Network, and a partnership with digital media company Fullscreen to rev up Martha's presence on YouTube.
2012^"  The jailed Russian punk rock group Pussy Riot did not gain international fame through their musicality per se. That insight appears in an academic paper by three electronic-commerce researchers from the University of Texas, Austin. The 45-page paper, filled with equations and Greek letters, explains how being deliberately offensive can help a video break through the clutter on YouTube, where 72 hours' worth of video are uploaded every minute. The paper explains the two reasons people click on a video that lots of other people have clicked on. One is ""social learning""; the fact that others have watched it tells you it must be good. A very different reason is ""network effect""; whether the video is good or not, it becomes more valuable to watch it if others are watching it."
2012^  Michael Carter's company, Game Closure, builds tools that let game developers write one version of their genius idea, then publish it anywhere. At its core, HTML 5 is a set of standards that lets Web browsers understand animations, videos, graphics, and other multimedia content without the need to download a plug-in like Adobe's Flash, which is how most Web videos and graphics are displayed today. The goal of HTML 5, which is gradually making its way into all modern browsers, including ones on mobile devices, is to make sites look and feel just like apps downloaded directly to a phone or desktop. Some worry the rush to HTML 5 could lead to shoddier software. Since the very idea behind HTML 5 is universality, it may discourage developers from tailoring their code to the capabilities of specific devices.
2012^  In an interview, Dick Glover, CEO of FunnyOrDie.com, talked about his strategy for the humor on the site. Glover believes in a model of: keep the cost of content and marketing low, keep the quality high. You can be very successful. By and large, for short-form videos, the celebrity talent are compensated in a number of ways but not a cash remuneration: complete creative freedom, great promotional vehicle for whatever else they may be doing. By marketing on a media system that exists online, there are ways to reach people on a daily basis that isn't like having to spend $1 million on an ad on Thursday-night television. The greatest challenge has always been, and will always continue to be, to be funny every day, everywhere, again and again.
2012^"  The term ""Internet memes"" is derived from genetics, describing the evolution of ideas and cultural phenomena by natural selection. These days, meme is the catchall for freely copied and altered tidbits of amusing online content, from animations and photo captions to viral videos that inspire a flood of parodies. Within weeks, most fade to oblivion, but those with endurance make the leap to the commercial world. Properly exploited, some memes can bring in anywhere from a few thousand dollars for a single licensed broadcast of a popular video to six figures for an integrated marketing campaign based around a meme. In the past two years, Lashes has helped clients license memes to brands such as Nike, Nokia, Wonderful Pistachios, and Lipton Brisk Iced Tea, which uses the Scumbag Steve photo in a new Web ad. Memes are a tremendous asset for brands because, like celebrities, they have an audience that recognizes and appreciates them."
2012^"  The Department of Justice begins an antitrust probe into whether Comcast, Time Warner, and other cable providers are now trying to manipulate the way customers use the Internet -- specifically, whether imposing caps on the amount of data people can download monthly discourages them from using Netflix, Hulu, and other rival online video sites and steers them to the cable companies' own video-on-demand services, which aren't subject to the caps. Comcast and other Internet providers want customers to accept that they are the proprietors of separate, special Internets. It can be seen in the way they've tried to rebrand the Web as a private product. Comcast refers to its Web access as ""Xfinity."" AT&amp;T calls it ""U-Verse."" Verizon doesn't sell Web access, either. It sells ""FiOS."""
2012^  Penny Arcade, which publishes online comics and puts on related events, is trying to use Kickstarter, the popular crowdfunding platform, with an ambitious campaign aimed at replacing the revenue it currently gets from advertising with funding from fans. Penny Arcade began as a simple video-game-oriented Web comic that writer Jerry Holkins and artist Mike Krahulik posted semi-regularly online in the late 1990s, and it has become a regular series with a number of associated real-world products and its own gaming conference called PAX. In its description of the Kickstarter campaign and related blog post, Holkins said eventually he and Krahulik wondered whether the platform would allow them to raise enough money to go back to a fully reader-funded mode.
2012^  Roku's media streamer has become a go-to device for small online video services that target expats all over the world. The first live-television feeds on Roku were foreign-broadcast transmissions, and numerous companies have used Roku exclusively to reach expat audiences within the US. But for many developers, all this came to a halt when Roku removed 25 channels with foreign-language content, effectively shutting down the entire international section of its channel store. The reason for this move is that Roku struck a distribution agreement with Dish Network in May, which makes the satellite provider's DishWorld service the exclusive distributor of foreign programming on the platform. Customers can use DishWorld to subscribe to packages of content from such countries as India and Brazil, with streams delivered directly to their Roku boxes -- no satellite subscription required.
2012^  If Google is essential to navigating the Web, Getty Images has become essential to visualizing it. Cobbled together through acquisitions, Getty is the world's largest photo and video agency, and its database of 80 million images is the raw material from which many of the Web's slide shows and photo galleries are made. A search for its images of happy people, for instance, turns up 626,317 results. That depth allows Getty to license its image trove online to all manner of bloggers and Web sites, businesses small and large, advertisers, newspapers, and magazines. With annual revenue approaching $1 billion, according to Getty, it's become a media business too important to ignore. Carlyle Group certainly took notice: On Aug 15, the private equity firm agreed to buy majority ownership of Getty from another private equity investor, Hellman &amp; Friedman, in a deal that values the company at $3.3 billion.
2012^  Google has long dominated online advertising in much of the world by placing ads next to search results, and it was expected to do the same in China. But since the company's 2010 decision to stop self-censoring Web content on the mainland and move its China servers to Hong Kong, Google's business has fallen further behind Baidu, the local search champ. Now, with the help of a recent acquisition, Google has managed to carve out a market niche where it's the mainland leader: ads aimed at mobile phones. Mobile-search advertising goes beyond generating ads related to searches and automatically sends ads to users playing games, viewing videos, or using other apps on their smartphones and tablet computers.
2012^  Consumers have plenty of ways to watch movies over the Internet. There's Netflix, Amazon.com Instant Video, Wal-Mart Stores' Vudu, and Apple's iTunes. Now the market for buying and renting films online is about to get more crowded. A new service, Redbox Instant by Verizon, plans to throw open its virtual doors to customers willing to pay $8 a month. Subscribers will gain online access to a catalog of older films at no extra fee, an on-demand store of newer movies available for rent or purchase, and DVD rental credits good for four recent releases each month from Redbox's kiosks at supermarkets and drugstores around the US. So far, studios seem to like the approach.
2012^"  On the morning of Oct 18, 2012, shortly after publishing a Newsweek cover story entitled, ""Heaven Is Real,"" editor-in-chief Tina Brown informed her staff that the magazine itself would soon be joining the afterlife. In a challenging environment for print advertising, Brown explained, she and executives at Barry Diller's IAC had decided to instead publish Newsweek Global, a digital-only magazine supported by subscriptions and targeting a highly mobile, opinion-leading audience that consumes news on tablets, e-readers, and smartphones. However, industry analysts say going digital, while a reliable approach for rapidly cutting costs, remains an uncertain path to revitalization. Newsweek Global, which will launch in early 2013, will have to compete for ad dollars not only with the digital operations of its print adversaries, such as Time, but also with a new breed of search engine and social media news outlets such as BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post; robust indie blog networks such as Gawker Media; and video-savvy general news sites such as CNN.com."
2012^  It wasn't so long ago that the notion of kids having their own tablet computers seemed excessive. But as tablets flood the market in record numbers -- more than 27 million were purchased in the third quarter alone, according to market researcher IDC -- it's become clear that the entertainment-laden devices are tailor-made for smaller hands. That's why in December the online retailer started positioning its hot-selling tablet as a makeshift toy. Amazon introduced FreeTime Unlimited, a subscription multimedia service for the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD aimed exclusively at children between the ages of three and eight. Amazon is heavily promoting the service's parental controls, which allow adults to limit the time each child can spend watching videos and restricts purchases kids can make while online. While the digital media landscape has been perilous for paid subscription services, there's evidence that FreeTime Unlimited could succeed where others failed because it's built on unfettered access to a bottomless well of content.
2012^"  On Monday afternoon, visitors to ABCNews.com who wanted to learn more about the latest news on the tragedy in Newtown, CT, had a range of Web video options to choose among. But before they could watch, say, ""Newtown Shooting: Teachers and Parents Turn to School Security,"" visitors had to first sit through a playful ad for skin-care products. This represents a tricky and growing challenge for news organizations. According to EMarketer, online video is the fastest growing category of Web ads; spending is expected to skyrocket from $2.93 billion in 2012 to $8.04 billion in 2016. When disaster strikes, be it a mass shooting, a terrorist attack, or a deadly storm, broadcasters attempt to strike a balance between making money from the surge in online viewers and managing advertisers' reluctance to be seen alongside tragic news."
2013^  The Roppongi Hills studio is central to YouTube's first significant effort at audience-building in Asia. The online video giant's other two studios, in Los Angeles and London, help popular creators develop original programming for its online video channels. In Japan, YouTube's biggest regional success story in Asia, the company is recruiting online video stars to bolster its local-language channels with more targeted original programming and higher production values. Local programming is important for advertisers who want to reach Asian audiences, says Trevor Healy, Singapore-based CEO of mobile advertising agency Amobee. In Japan, YouTube and other Google video sites had 50.8 million unique viewers in December, a 30% rise over the same period a year earlier, according to comScore data.
2013^  In March 5 a 16-year-old Texan named Austin Mahone posted a video to YouTube in which he and some buddies dance to Harlem Shake, an electronic single turned viral phenomenon. The song, by the Brooklyn producer Baauer, came out as a free download last spring. The Harlem Shake is not simply the latest fad to take up temporary residence in our hips. The craze highlights permanent changes in how the music industry works and looks. Since YouTube's inception in 2005, the site's been known primarily as a bottomless Big Gulp brimming with Webcam confessionals, cute-mammal footage, and assorted other Web junk. The best-known YouTube alum is Justin Bieber, once a wee Canadian nobody who began showcasing his angelic whinny on the site in 2007. On a smaller scale, the future may look something like another Mad Decent artist, the eccentric rapper RiffRaff who's built a thriving career by flooding YouTube with cheap videos for songs he cranks out at a feverish pace.
2013^"  Scott Schreer is an indie musician, but not the garage-band variety. The composer licenses his 1,700 musical works, designed as scenic background music, to film and television producers. Less gratifyingly, he can also hear them used, without permission, in thousands of videos on YouTube. Hunting those stray recordings and trying to collect licensing fees from the video-sharing Google subsidiary didn't seem worth the trouble. Then Schreer started using Audiam. Audiam's program combs YouTube for videos that feature unlicensed music, using audio-matching software and YouTube's own Content ID system. Founder Jeff Price, a friend of Schreer's, pitches musicians like this: ""Let's go find you money that already exists. It's buried treasure."""
2013^  A few weeks ago, a two-and-a-half minute video called Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise circulated online. The coffee shop was a real coffee shop -- 'sNice in Manhattan's West Village -- and the looks of horror on customers' faces were genuine. The prank was funny and fascinating, and has since been watched more than 46 million times on YouTube and discussed on both Good Morning America and CNN. It's also, technically speaking, a commercial. The prank and resulting video were a promotional stunt for Sony Pictures' Carrie remake; this becomes evident when the movie's title and release date appear at the end. The need to be shared and go viral is the new orthodoxy of online media. But it's also something that's incredibly difficult to engineer. There is, of course, one problem with using unsuspecting bystanders' genuine emotional reactions to sell your product: Sometimes they don't like it.
2013^  Measured by bytes, the two sites Netflix and YouTube now make up more than half of Internet traffic in the US, according to Sandvine's latest Global Internet Phenomena Report using data from September. This year the duo crossed the halfway point, hitting 50.3%. Notably lagging are two other widely discussed video services: Hulu and Amazon (AMZN). Both companies are slipping from their already lowly traffic numbers: Amazon accounted for 1.6% of total downstream traffic in September, compared with an average of 1.75% in the second half of 2012. This mammoth disparity is a way to set the stage for what should be a big week for Amazon's video streaming service, which is releasing its first original television series.
2013^  Before its video went live on YouTube, almost nobody had heard of Coin. In the one-minute, 45-second ad, a schlubby, bearded guy demonstrates how to use the credit card-size device to electronically store up to eight cards that can be used to pay at a checkout counter and a restaurant. Posted on Nov 14, the ad has close to seven million views. Coin reached its first-month sales goal of $50,000 less than an hour after it went up for preorders online. CEO Kanishk Parashar says that's due in large part to the ad, which helped attract greater interest from consumers and contract manufacturers. Adam Lisagor made the ad. A former journeyman film editor and the founder of Sandwich Video, he has emerged as the director of choice among Silicon Valley startups looking to gain visibility. In 2010, when he started making the videos, there were only a few filmmakers specializing in the app-demo business.
2013^  In a report this week, the Superior Audiovisual Council (CSA) says that video-sharing Web sites should be subject to a tax that helps finance the production of French films and television shows. The so-called culture tax, totaling more than E1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) annually, is paid by movie theaters, broadcasters, and Internet service providers in France. The CSA contends that YouTube, French video-sharing site DailyMotion, and their ilk are effectively providing video-on-demand services, which are already subject to the tax. Although the CSA report says that videos posted online by private individuals should not be subject to taxation, it contends that video-sharing sites increasingly have become professional content providers.
2013^  Online advertising firm Thinkmodo makes videos for companies such as Oakley, AMC Networks, and CBS Films, and almost every one has been watched more than a million times -- many of them more than 10 million. Thinkmodo's last ad was a two-and-a-half-minute promo for Sony Pictures Entertainment's Carrie remake that featured a woman using her telekinetic powers to freak out coffee shop patrons. Released in October, it's been viewed more than 52 million times on YouTube; Google recently ranked it the second-most-watched online ad of the year. The company's videos follow a specific formula. First, co-founder Michael Krivicka says, you have to play on people's emotions. Don't show the product or advertise the film too blatantly, or people will stop watching. When filming a prank, make it as authentic as possible while guarding against lawsuits.
2013^  Consumers have plenty of ways to watch movies over the Internet. There's Netflix, Amazon.com Instant Video, Wal-Mart Stores' Vudu, and Apple's iTunes. Now the market for buying and renting films online is about to get more crowded. A new service, Redbox Instant by Verizon, plans to throw open its virtual doors to customers willing to pay $8 a month. Subscribers will gain online access to a catalog of older films at no extra fee, an on-demand store of newer movies available for rent or purchase, and DVD rental credits good for four recent releases each month from Redbox's kiosks at supermarkets and drugstores around the US. So far, studios seem to like the approach.
2013^"  Fresh off the launch of its new Kevin Spacey political drama, House of Cards, Netflix is planning an original animated children's series. Turbo: F.A.S.T. (Fast Action Stunt Team) is a spin-off from the DreamWorks Animation studio film Turbo, which is set for release July 19. For Netflix, which recently bolstered its kid-friendly offerings by signing an exclusivity deal with Walt Disney, the Turbo series will be its first ""in-house"" production aimed at children. Netflix's push to increase its original programming is an effort to distinguish the company from other online video services, such as Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, which often carry the same older television shows and movies as Netflix does. Netflix also licensed rights to stream Disney's older content as part of the transaction."
2013^"  The revamped Yahoo.com, which goes live on Wednesday morning, represents Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer's boldest attempt yet to remake and update the Web giant she took over last July. Most visibly, the redesign draws on a key element of Facebook and Twitter, introducing a ""news feed"" of live, endlessly scrollable content, which includes news stories, videos, and messages from advertisers. The overhaul, which has a clean look and dramatic highlights in purple, was led in part by Jackie Goldberg, Yahoo's design director and a former creative director at Hewlett-Packard. Mayer says she met with the team once a week over the past few months. The redesign also gives Yahoo new opportunities to host advertisements on its most profitable real estate."
2013^  On March 13 Netflix introduced a revamped integration with Facebook, showing its 33 million online members on the Netflix home page which movies and television episodes their Facebook friends have watched. Users can also post to Facebook individual videos they've loved or hated and discuss them on their timelines. Sharing video rental data is Netflix CEO Reed Hastings's latest effort to change how people watch movies and television. Unlike HBO and the broadcast networks, Netflix lets viewers watch as many episodes as they wish on their own schedule. Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes has criticized the strategy, saying Hastings makes it easy for people to drop the service after they've quickly seen what they like. Netflix is betting its new social features will get subscribers to stick around and remain part of the online conversation.
2013^  One of the business lessons Dave Howe has learned during his time as president of the Syfy cable network: Six-foot-tall extraterrestrials are a lot less expensive than 12-foot-tall ones. That knowledge came in handy during production of Defiance, Syfy's new series about aliens who come to earth and their prickly relationship with the current inhabitants. Defiance is being simultaneously produced as a video game; the developers at Trion Worlds, Syfy's gaming partner, wanted some of the alien characters to be 12 feet tall. Defiance is perhaps the most ambitious transmedia project yet: A television show and massively multiplayer online video game where plot elements from the weekly show bleed into the real-time cyberworld of the game. The series debuted on April 15 to an audience of 2.7 million, making it the most successful launch in seven years for Syfy, which is owned by NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast.
2013^  It's been nearly eight years since Microsoft performed a major overhaul of its Xbox video game console. In that time, the Xbox has demonstrated remarkable resilience, thriving amid huge shifts in the types of devices and online services people like to use. It may be Microsoft's only beloved consumer product, in part because the company hasn't mucked up its winning formula. With the gaming market shifting away from consoles, though, Microsoft is doing a little tinkering. The goal is to move its system decisively beyond gaming and transform the Xbox into an entertainment hub for users' televisions. They turn a television that's delivered to you one-way through a straw into a two-way experience that understands what's going on with you, says Xbox division head Don Mattrick. Microsoft's bid to manage more home entertainment includes customizing the new Xbox to keep each family member happy.
2013^  In an interview, Tom Freston, the former head of Viacom, talked about breakfast with Oprah Winfrey, Afghan TV, and the killer media app. On what's it like to move between Winfrey and Shane Smith, Freston said Smith has an interesting bunch of guys. And Winfrey is wonderful. She romanced me into helping her. She made breakfast for me. What alliances he sees coming, Freston said the next wave is going to be online video. With all the extra screens -- the iPads and the iPhones -- and the social tools, soon the killer application is going to come along for navigation, which will make this all seamless.
2013^  Raghu Venkat was at his breaking point in 2010. After he spent months helping to fine-tune the analytics software behind Aster Data Systems, his bosses ordered him to take a two-week vacation and handed him a $1,500 prepaid debit card as a bonus for his hard work. He spent the money on a massive widescreen television and a couple of video game systems, making his apartment the new home base for co-workers Manav Mital and Hariharan Kolam. Soon, Venkat was obsessed with games like Bioshock. Out of the desire for speedier gaming and online services came the idea for Instart Logic, the Mountain View (CA)-based company the trio quit their jobs to found. Instart's software determines what users tend to look for on a given Web site and breaks desired Web pages into prioritized chunks.
2013^  More than 100 employees of Bigcommerce, a four-year-old company, are on their feet or perched on swings in its huge game room, with plate-glass views out over Hill Country. Executive Steve Case, overdressed from a meeting earlier in the day at the US Capitol, is in a button-down shirt, pleated slacks, and tasseled loafers, looking a generation older than the scruffy dot-com workers he's about to address. For any startup, a new round of funding is an ecstatic occasion. Getting the money from Case -- billionaire co-founder of America Online, father of the consumer Internet -- brings a sense of destiny: Maybe this company will become legendary, too. In 1983, Case was a 24-year-old marketer for Pizza Hut when his older brother, an investment banker, helped him get a job at a small company that was trying to make video games interactive. That venture failed, but another one sprouted up.
2013^"  In any estimate of the world's bestselling authors, there is William Shakespeare, Agatha Christie, and everyone else. With at least five titles that topped the New York Times bestseller list, Tom Clancy is one of the bigger names in the ""everyone else"" category. Today, literary franchises can hit Clancy-type sales numbers in a few hours, but books were just a part of the Clancy universe. There were also the feature films stocked with A-list actors -- four in all: The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, and The Sum of All Fears. In total, the films grossed $616 million at theatres, according to Box Office Mojo. Clancy's name also powered up a video-game company, Red Storm Entertainment, which had a string of hits, including Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon."
2013^  The National Football League (NFL) has $6 billion worth of annual incentives to keep Americans from watching games online. So fiercely does the league guard its lucrative television deals that to watch football online in the US, fans still have to pay a television provider: The only Americans who are technically allowed to watch NFL's live streams are those customers who purchase DirecTV's all-access Sunday Ticket package, a deal worth $1 billion to the NFL. For just a couple of dollars cord-cutting fans could digitally pretend to be from somewhere overseas, which would give you access to every single NFL game, live and in high definition, through your Internet connection. That's the promise of Canadian startup Adfreetime.com, one of a handful of providers to offer what's called a DNS-switching service. Adfreetime and such rivals as Unblock-us.com, which charges $4.99 per month for a similar region-switching service, have made it easy and remarkably cheap to get access to all kinds of streaming video.
2013^"  Apparently unsatisfied with acquiring countless tech startups, Yahoo has gone out and acquired David Pogue. The erstwhile New York Times tech columnist announced the move via Tumblr, appropriately enough, on an account that he apparently started over the weekend. Pogue will be helping Yahoo build a consumer-tech site, which will include online columns, goofy videos, and mysterious ""real-world creations."" The move seems to make sense for him. He has benefited immensely from his relationship with the Times and has used it to build a pretty good name for himself. The hiring fits into what Yahoo has been trying to do, too. The plan seems to be to come up with as many ways to drive traffic as possible and figure out how to make money later."
2013^"  Twitter quietly rolled out a new feature -- or irritant, depending on how you look at it -- for users of its Web site on Tuesday, as well as for its iOS and Android apps: Photo and video previews now show up as expanded images directly in a tweet instead of requiring users to click on a link. Some fans of the move welcomed the new feature, but others seemed taken aback by all the multimedia filling their streams, and by the Facebook-style feel it gives to Twitter. In addition to appealing to advertisers, which now get to insert what amount to banner ads into their streams the feature is likely aimed at attracting new users and encouraging them to use Twitter -- something the tech industry calls ""on-boarding."""
2013^  Arnold Donald had been on the board of Carnival for 12 years when he got a call in June from the cruise company's lead director, Stuart Subotnick. It was an offer to succeed Micky Arison as Carnival's CEO, and Donald was incredulous. Donald's skepticism was understandable. Arison, the son of Carnival's founder, had run the company for 34 years; Donald, a former Monsanto executive, had no prior cruise-operating experience. Carnival -- the world's largest cruise company with 10 brands ranging from the low-cost Carnival to the pricey 173-year-old British Cunard Line -- had been in crisis since its Costa Concordia ran aground off the Italian coast in 2012, killing 32 people. That was followed by more incidents this year, including a fire aboard the Carnival Triumph in February that further tarnished the company's image with extensive news video of passengers stranded at sea. Among Donald's first steps were meetings with travel agents to repair relations frayed in recent years as the company put more emphasis on automated online bookings.
2013^  A chapter in a soon-to-be-published book on the digital economy by the National Bureau of Economic Research makes a compelling case for media companies speeding up efforts to get as much of their content online as possible. The study looks at what happened in 2009, when ABC added a chunk of television shows to Hulu, the popular streaming-video service. The results were immediate and striking: Illegal downloads of those shows dropped almost 20% compared with a control group. Content companies are coming up with more legal ways to find media online, and at the same time file sharing is dropping off. A recent analysis of overall Internet activity by Sandvine showed that file sharing as a whole has dropped from 31% of traffic in 2008 to less than 10% today.
2013^  For some truly strange advertisements, look no further than the National Cable &amp; Television Association's Hole Saga, a Web site consisting of several pro-cable video sketches. The videos, which have been running for just over a week, discuss the hole in people's hearts that is formed by an absence of cable. The concept is strange in that it's based on people having a loving relationship with a cable provider. People should probably give cable a break. It's not the best time to be running a pay television company. Cable companies lost 687,000 subscribers in the last quarter. Many of those people moved to satellite television or fiber optic options offered by telecoms, meaning that the industry lost 113,000 subscribers over that period, according to analyst Craig Moffett.
2013^  Television has been the last stand of traditional media, but the time has come for it to defend its turf. After flirting with video advertising for much of the year, Facebook said Tuesday that it will begin to put promoted videos into its news feed. Facebook users will roll their eyes and post status updates about being annoyed. But success for the video ads could genuinely threaten television companies. The markets for advertising in other types of traditional media have been decimated by the Internet. But while television ad sales dipped when the recession hit, they soon recovered and have continued to climb. This is primarily because television remains the last true mass-market medium, according to Paul Sweeney of Bloomberg Industries. Piecing together an audience by buying various types of advertising is simply less efficient than slapping an ad on television.
2013^  Among Christopher Widauer's duties as technical director of the Vienna State Opera is to make sure spectators in his 2,100 seats can clearly see the stage as well as translations of the libretto. He had to consider a much bigger audience when his bosses said they wanted to earn additional revenue with Web and mobile HD simulcasts -- without the delays and hiccups that often interrupt online videos. The opera house is one of more than 600 clients that have relied on software maker Ooyala to help them set up and manage streaming video services. Mountain View (CA)-based Ooyala is one of a handful of companies that provide such back-end services, selling subscription-based software that helps automate online video programming and ad delivery.
2014^  Among big consumer Web businesses, there may be no tougher battlefield than video sharing. For video connoisseurs, though, the mainstream services leave a big gap: None combine the reliable, ad-free HD video of Netflix with the kind of marketplace democracy that birthed YouTube's endless stream of cat videos. It's a gap that Vimeo, the video-sharing site loved by artsy filmmakers and long ignored by the market, is starting to fill. Ad-free since its founding in 2004, Vimeo receives about 100 million unique viewers a month through its home page and from other sites that embed its video player, according to CEO Kerry Trainor. The company introduced its on-demand video service to lure more filmmakers and boost subscription sales. So far the site's 4,400 on-demand videos fall somewhere between Netflix's original series and YouTube.
2014^  The YouTube land grab continues: Otter Media, a joint venture between the Chernin Group and AT&amp;T, said it had bought a majority stake in Fullscreen, one of the biggest YouTube networks, in a deal that Bloomberg reports is valued between $200 million and $300 million. It's just the latest in a steady stream of acquisitions that mark the arrival of the really big money to the YouTube market. The world of online video, particularly the stuff favored by younger users, has been built by tiny operations drawing huge audiences to low-budget works. Such companies as Fullscreen came in over the last couple of years and promised professional services to help the little guys scale, signing up creators who thought they might not make it by themselves.
2014^  For years after 1989, when the first episode of America's Funniest Home Videos, aka AFV, aired in prime time on ABC, creator Vin Di Bona trained millions of amateur videographers to mail him their best material. But along came the Internet, and suddenly people no longer needed a television show to share their kid's hilarious trampoline accident with a mass audience. Nevertheless, AFV remains a formidable force in television. In October the series kicked off its 25th season on ABC, making it the network's longest-running prime time entertainment series. But for the first time, AFV is also aggressively extending its brand across the Web, catering to new fans on Facebook, Twitter, image-hosting site Imgur -- and the once-feared YouTube in particular. The show currently operates three YouTube channels: AFV Official, AFV Animals, and AFV Kids, with more YouTube features on the way.
2014^  On Wednesday, Dec 17, two former Hulu executives offered a preview of their new company, Vessel. Like Hulu, the company will offer a free service with advertisements and a premium service with a subscription fee. In Vessel's case, the subscriptions will cost $2.99 a month and will feature exclusive content from creators who grant the company a three-day window during which videos will play only on its site. For months there have been rumors about potential YouTube competitors. Aside from the Vessel founders, much of the speculation has centered on George Strompolos, the CEO of YouTube network Fullscreen. If there's a way to succeed at this, Vessel is well positioned to do so.
2014^  Nickelodeon will on Monday air the first episode of ReactToThat, a television show based on the steady stream of skits, sitcoms, and assorted silliness produced by two of YouTube's biggest stars, brothers from Brooklyn named Benny and Rafi Fine. ReactToThat is basically Kids Say the Darndest Things for the YouTube generation, with panels of children asked to weigh on various cultural and social phenomena. Their success has resulted in a strange sort of obscure celebrity. Hollywood is paying increasing attention to artists who have already made names for themselves online, a reflection of just how big YouTube creators have become among young people. Kids now think YouTube's stars shine brighter than those of Hollywood celebrities, according to a survey of 1,500 teenagers conducted in July for Variety by Jeetendr Sehdev, a professor of marketing at the University of Southern California. The fledgling crossovers from YouTube to the offline entertainment industry is also an acknowledgement of the difficult economics of Web video.
2014^"  Google has already been winning the Super Bowl for weeks. The tech giant's YouTube platform has welcomed a windfall from companies trying to build buzz for the lavish commercials they will air during the big game. Some 17 corporations have already posted ""teaser ads"" on YouTube, according to Google, and while they're free to post, these companies are paying for promotion spots on mastheads, through search results, and in front of other YouTube videos. Ironically, as Super Bowl airtime becomes more expensive, it has become critical for companies to spend heavily to prime viewers. Google, meanwhile, expects the Super Bowl ad blitz to come earlier next year."
2014^  YouTube has been nibbling around the edges of the television industry's $60 billion lunch for some time now. Last night The Information reported that Susan Wojcicki is the candidate likely to take over the video site; Google has neither confirmed nor denied the report. In any case, the challenges for the head of YouTube are clear: The site is one of Google's biggest opportunities to make billions in ad dollars without convincing users to do something differently than what they're already doing. The job now is to get YouTube to grow up. In a way, Wojcicki is an ideal choice, given her deep experience in advertising. But she'd have to help Google develop some new muscles. Video ads are about branding, an arena in which success is harder to measure and habits are deeply ingrained.
2014^"  The GoPro is a tiny, wearable camera, often used by skiers and surfers, that captures and produces high-quality video. Since March 2009, more than 620 GoPro-posted videos have attracted 440 million-plus views, according to YouTube spokesman Matt McLernon. GoPro's own channel ranks in the top 350 on YouTube, and the company's customers are even more prolific. The number of videos with ""GoPro"" in the title has grown so much that watching 2013's crop alone would take you 2.8 years. The privately held company keeps its financials confidential, and because of the pre-IPO ""quiet period"" mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, its executives aren't saying much right now. In December 2012, Foxconn Technology invested $200 million in GoPro, valuing the company at $2.3 billion. At the time, CEO Nicholas Woodman asserted that GoPro's revenue had been doubling every year, to $500 million in 2012."
2014^  Seven years ago Viacom demanded $1 billion from Google because YouTube was rife with videos that had been posted without regard for Viacom's copyrights. The two companies finally settled the dispute on Tuesday, with Re/Code reporting that no money changed hands. In a sense, Viacom finally gave in after signs mounted over the years that it wasn't going to win. A judge ruled in 2013 that it was Viacom's responsibility, not Google's, to find the offending videos. When Viacom filed its initial suit, Google had just begun to experiment with YouTube ads, and the entire online video advertising industry brought in about $580 million, far less than what Viacom itself made from advertising for its media networks.
2014^  A question about how to successfully monetize Web videos are answered. Most independent producers are hobbyists, posting homemade videos for friends and family without worrying about making money from their efforts. But others are finding ways to profit from their videos, and some are even turning them into lucrative, full-time entrepreneurial ventures. The first part -- reaching a targeted viewership -- is not difficult for many online content producers. Most are making videos about their own interests and expertise and aiming them at narrow slices of viewers. Yet even a highly targeted audience can be huge: A beauty industry survey released in February by video software analysis company Pixability counted 700 million YouTube beauty video views every month. That gets into the second key to monetization: building a loyal audience large enough to interest advertisers. Finally, devote the time to interact with your viewers and subscribers.
2014^  A simmering dispute between Google and independent record labels could result this week in the disappearance from YouTube of Adele, the Arctic Monkeys, and additional artists signed to smaller labels. YouTube is in the process of creating a paid subscription service to go alongside its existing service, and the online-video giant has been negotiating deals with artists. This would seem a good thing for the music industry: Labels make more money when fans listen to songs on paid subscription services than they do when fans use YouTube as a free music player. For the most part, labels are on board with the plan. YouTube says 95% of artists have signed deals. But the fight over the final 5% is getting nasty. A number of indie labels are holding out because they don't like the terms they've been offered, and songs that aren't covered by the new streaming service will soon be removed from YouTube altogether.
2014^  Considering the popularity of food and cooking shows on television -- from traditional how-to programs to contrived competitions -- it's only natural that food videos are proliferating online too. Subscriptions to the 300 most-viewed food channels on YouTube more than tripled in 2013 over the previous year and views of videos on those channels jumped 59%, according to a new analysis by Google. Viewers seek everything from recipes to such cooking basics as how to grill. Still, many food videos that go viral have one other component in common -- they're entertaining in the sense that they're absurd, or at least kind of silly, which is one way these online videos distinguish themselves from their rivals on television. Ten of the most-watched food and beverage videos published on YouTube in June are presented.
2014^  Three decades after his song-parody debut, Weird Al Yankovic is on track to have his first No. 1 album. The final sales numbers won't be released until later this week, but Billboard magazine has him neck and neck with Jason Mraz for the top spot. For years, Yankovic's shtick depended on the existence of the MTV-watching, album-purchasing public. Now his publicity and distribution model is doubly obsolete, and thousands of YouTube-empowered enthusiasts are doing exactly what Weird Al does -- and at a much quicker pace than a major-label release schedule allows. The Internet should have made Weird Al Yankovic irrelevant years ago. In fact, it has done the opposite. There is one other reason why Yankovic has stayed remarkably relevant over the past 30 years: his music. And his subject matter is usually more approachable than the original pop songs.
2014^  When Brian Robbins first told people he was going full time into the YouTube business, his colleagues in Hollywood were incredulous. For decades, Robbins had worked in the traditional entertainment industry, first as a teenage actor starring in the ABC sitcom Head of the Class, then as a producer of television shows about teenagers. It was steady and lucrative work, if not always the most prestigious. Robbins's timing was good. After years of more or less passive support, YouTube was starting to take an active role in original programming, encouraging entrepreneurs, producers, and established television stars to start channels, which on YouTube refers to a collection of videos hosted by an individual or by a creative team. In Jun 2012, Robbins launched his YouTube channel, which he named AwesomenessTV. The channel was geared to teenagers and preteens and featured lots of two- to five-minute videos, which ranged from quickie talk shows about beauty tips to mini-reality shows about cheerleaders.
2014^  According to Kathleen Grace, owner of production company New Form Digital, a series of big-name companies such as YouTube and Verizon has been pouring money into digital-video offerings, most trying to differentiate themselves with shows or movies that can't be found elsewhere. Because many of them are asking customers to pay, rather than have them only watch ads, those companies have to work that much harder to draw in viewers. Digital-video producers, especially those focused on programming for smartphones, are enjoying something they didn't have a few years ago: a seller's market. Call it the Netflix effect. The streaming leader's steady push into original shows and movies has forced rivals such as Amazon.com and Hulu to do the same. The new competitors, including YouTube Red and Go90, have learned the lesson. Exclusivity has worked effectively for Netflix, said Peter Csathy, the CEO of consultant Manatt Digital Media.
2014^  Dollar Shave Club, a startup launched two years ago on the strength of a single, silly viral video, has started to grow up. More than a million customers spend about $7 million each month to get razor blades and other grooming products in the mail. Becoming a serious business hasn't changed the tenor of the ads -- still sophomoric and hilarious -- but Dollar Shave Club has shifted its marketing focus from YouTube to traditional television commercials. In the past two years, as Dollar Shave and its competitors ramped up, the number of razors sold at convenience stores has sunk by 2% and the number of blades sold in those shops plummeted by 19%, according to Nielsen data.
2014^  Netflix could one day hit a wall in its US subscriber growth -- with every American who wants it already subscribing -- but that day is certainly not here yet. The video subscription service added 2.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, including free trial subscriptions, giving it a total of 33.4 million in the US. That was enough to top the 33.1 million average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. At peak times, Netflix viewers represent about a third of US broadband Internet capacity, according to some estimates.
2014^  There is a Web site where cats and dogs rule the day, profanities are common, and clips from Lord of the Rings movies can be used to convey universal sentiments like the joy of revenge. Although it looks like just another photo-sharing hub, it's the best example yet of how a new generation of Internet users prefers to express itself. Imgur is a place to post and browse GIFs, the Internet's de facto file format for pictures and short, punchy animated clips designed for sharing on social networks. Imgur's already profitable, thanks to a stream of display ads from movie studios and video game publishers, and is well on its way to becoming one of the highest-traffic sites in the world, with more than 120 million monthly unique visitors posting images and searching for jolts of humor and insight.
2014^"  Three years after Netflix increased its prices and sparked a painful backlash that savaged its share price, executives at the online-video service are once again testing various prices and streaming combinations beyond $7.99 per month for new members. Last spring, Netflix started an option aimed at families to allow four simultaneous streams for $11.99 per month, and the company has been testing different prices for standard resolution, high definition, and concurrent streaming options. In December, the company began a $6.99 monthly plan that allows streaming to only one screen, and executives spoke of their efforts to find a three-tier ""good, better, best"" pricing plan."
2014^  Bloomberg View's Jonathan Weill calls attention to the case of Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who appears to have single-handedly sent the stock price of a UK company plummeting after publishing an article on his Web site last week. Edelman says that digital media company Blinx, which was recently worth more than $1.2 billion, employs Internet advertising techniques, including pop-up ads, that users dislike, and that cause advertisers to be charged for video ads systematically not visible to users.
2014^  Variety is one of the true joys of the Olympics, a three-week span during which viewers can watch athletes from around the world skiing through the woods with guns, going on spandex-clad sled rides, and soaring above a crappy snowboard halfpipe, all within the course of an hour. But if you're watching NBC's online coverage, better brace yourself for some mind-numbing repetition: The same BP commercial has run three times in four minutes during a replay of the men's moguls, and one spot for Bounty paper towels played three times in a row during a single break. Seeing the same cluster of commercials repeated over an hours-long broadcast isn't unusual for sports fans. But what's merely annoying on television can be torturous for streaming video audiences, where the ad inventory tends to be far more limited.
2014^  On first viewing, it's really cute, that animated Coca-Cola commercial starring a puffin who can't open his bottle and the kindly polar bear who comes to his rescue. But lately people have been fantasizing about plucking the feathers off that smarmy puffin's wings. It's not that people hate polar birds; it's just that they have been forced to watch that ad about 100,000 times while using NBC's otherwise admirable streaming portal, nbcolympics.com. Unlike traditional television broadcasts in which advertisers purchase airtime during commercial breaks, NBC's online operation accepted ads only from its major sponsors for Olympics coverage. The perverse consequence is that by midway in any given event, people had endured Coke's tundra tear-jerker at least a half-dozen times, with few other offerings mixed in between. Repetition has become endemic in digital-video advertising for many sports broadcasts.
2014^  In their pursuit of controlling our every waking hour, tech giants have long tried to commandeer the television experience, and they have the bruises to show for it. Google and Apple, along with startup Roku, have managed to establish modestly popular set-top boxes that stream some movies and live shows to televisions. Now a new contestant has joined the battle for the living room. At a New York press conference on April 2, e-commerce giant Amazon.com unveiled Amazon Fire TV, a small, boxy device designed to stream the company's catalog of free and paid shows and movies into the living room and let users play online video games on their large-screen televisions. This is an ambitious frontal assault on the few businesses that can afford to outspend the retail giant, but for Amazon the potential rewards are uniquely obvious.
2014^  Billions of dollars may be at stake in the final round of the legal dispute between broadcast networks and the online streaming service Aereo, but the case will come down to the interpretation of two words: public performance. Aereo, a two-year-old startup funded by Barry Diller's IAC, charges viewers in about a dozen US markets $8 a month to record or stream live broadcast television signals to their PCs, smartphones, and tablets using dime-size antennas. On Apr 22, the Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments about whether Aereo's distribution of broadcasts infringes copyright law, which says that the rights holder controls the public performance of art -- music, plays, television shows, films. Aereo argues that a court decision against it would threaten a broad range of cloud computing services, because depending on how broad the decision is, it might restrict personal storage of media that users stream themselves. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
2014^ In the past 25 years the cost of broadcast rights for English Premier League soccer has surged thirty-fold as deep-pocketed media companies have grown to depend on live sports to win subscribers and keep them from defecting to online rivals. Next year an even richer bunch -- those same Internet giants that are wooing television viewers -- will likely show up at rights auctions, pushing prices even higher. Live sports attracts a passionate fan base, Greg Hart, video chief at Amazon.com Inc, said in August after signing a deal to offer Association of Tennis Professionals matches on Prime Video.
2014^  AOL executives trotted out the company's new slate of original video programming on Tuesday, part of the increasingly crowded digital NewFronts in New York. A room full of potential advertisers gazed on a lineup larded with big-name talent, including James Franco, Steve Buscemi, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Ellen DeGeneres. But in the end, one established star from the television universe overshadowed all the other would-be transplants scrambling to make a go of it online: Nielsen. For years, Nielsen has dominated the role of measuring television audiences while struggling to achieve the same kind of hegemony online. Over the past year, as part of an ongoing competition with the likes of ComScore, Nielsen has rolled out a number of new Web-audience measuring tools designed to strengthen its still tenuous standing in the evolving firmament.
2014^  If there is anything educational to be gleaned from time-wasting games such as Angry Birds, it's that the app store is a fickle benefactor. Rovio, the Finnish company that makes the game, is now feeling the impact of shifting tastes and trying to move beyond printing money in the form of one-dollar game downloads. The revenue Rovio made from gaming dropped from 2012 to 2013, the company said on Monday, and its profit fell more than 50%. All is not lost: Rovio did bring in more overall revenue than it did the year before and made $37 million in post-tax profit. And the folks behind Angry Birds have known for some time that the music won't play forever, which is why they have been trying to learn how to do two things very differently this time around.
2014^"  As anyone with a young child knows, a storybook or cartoon is the ultimate in ""long-tail"" media consumption: The 53rd rereading or re-watching is cherished just as much as the first time. And that's good news for Netflix, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs. The streaming-video giant has invested heavily in content for children at a time when kids are spending more time on mobile devices. Another positive: Kids have no tolerance for scheduled television, believing this should be an on-demand world, all the time -- Goldman knows kids are like that -- and Netflix follows no rigid programing schedule."
2014^  Every lovestruck teenager in the 1990s made mixtapes they thought were priceless. Google's acquisition of Songza, an online music service, shows that having a talent for mixtapes can net you at least $39 million. The initial genius of online radio was to have computers choose what songs played next, giving rise to a seemingly infinite universe of customized radio stations. Algorithmic disc jockeys (or video curators and news-feed editors) have become standard in most digital media businesses. Songza has a more refined ear. At its office in Queens, one finds a roomful of humans that sit around making playlists all day. The company's formula isn't immune to algorithms -- it uses them in hopes of serving the best playlist at a particular time.
2014^  Yet another popular television show has been plucked from the scrapheap by a fledgling online-video platform. This time it's Yahoo Screen buying an all-new season of Community, a Sony sitcom that NBC canceled in May after a five-season run. Such matchups between a castoff and an underdog platform are becoming an increasingly common twist in the entertainment industry's script. There are only two alternatives to buying new versions of defunct shows: airing reruns or bankrolling original shows. But it's hard to win attention with reruns, and creating new shows can be a fraught path, particularly for a media company such as Yahoo! that has no record of success in scripted programming.
2014^  The viral video strategy is savvy, not only because posting online is much cheaper than running traditional commercials, but also because of the target audience's growing spending power. In April 2013, Unilever's Dove scored the year's largest viral hit with its Real Beauty Sketches, which featured women surprised at how positively their looks are described by strangers. And even companies without female-centric products have gone the same route: Verizon showed a young girl admonished for pursuing technology and science, and Snickers created the confusingly titled You're Not You When You're Hungry, in which starving construction dudes accost women with positive comments. That hasn't stopped bloggers from complaining that the empowerment videos are gimmicky or condescending.
2014^  Netflix accounts for about a third of North America's Internet traffic on a typical evening, and VP for content delivery Ken Florance's team of 50 is charged with keeping the movies and television shows rolling. It's an enormous responsibility. On July 21 the company said its subscriptions had crossed the 50 million mark, accounting for $1.15 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up from $837 million in the same period last year. Florance, a happy-go-lucky pacifist with a cackle of a laugh, is now defending Netflix's interests in one of the nastiest fights in online history: the battle with Internet service providers (ISPs) and regulators over the fundamental structure of the Web. ISPs argue that Netflix takes up too much bandwidth and so any interruptions aren't their problem. Netflix's struggles with the ISPs are in some ways a reflection of its failure to negotiate traffic-sharing partnerships.
2014^  Netflix's second-quarter results popped out Monday afternoon, and here are the highlights: The company posted revenue of $1.15 billion vs. $837 million in the same period last year. Its net income hit $71 million, up from $29 million, and it now has more than 50 million customers worldwide -- 50.05 million, to be precise. Investors gave Netflix a pat on the back for increasing its subscribers at a healthy clip, sending shares 1% higher in after-hours trading. Netflix has spent more and risked more to become a real competitor to HBO and Showtime in programming while maintaining a technology edge over everyone.
2014^  Google appears to have reached an agreement to buy Twitch, a company whose main business is live-streaming videos of people playing video games. A pending deal was first reported by Variety in May, and now VentureBeat says an arrangement has been finalized and will be worth more than $1 billion. If such a deal goes through, it would be a massive validation for the burgeoning industry of watching other people play games.
2014^  The Internet was all in a tizzy Friday over a pressing issue of home entertainment. To paraphrase an infamous line from the hit sitcom, the prospect of Seinfeld on demand is real and it's spectacular. Chuck Larsen, the president of October Moon Television, an independent consulting firm that specializes in syndication rights, points out that Seinfeld's current syndication deals for both cable and broadcast television stations expire this fall. In the past, streaming subscription services such as Netflix might have balked at paying the huge syndication fees commanded by a top-shelf sitcom like Seinfeld. If Netflix does acquire the subscription video on demand rights, Larsen says, the series will continue to air on broadcast and cable television. And while it's likely that Seinfeld fans will soon have access to all 180 episodes somewhere online sometime soon, no deal has been announced yet.
2014^"  Kim Kardashian is the author's matchmaker. She's just set her up with a cute guy named Mitchell, who's a writer but ""not one of those nerdy sitcom writers,"" as she puts it. She meet Mitchell at Panino, a trendy restaurant in Beverly Hills, and opt to ""flirt"" with him. The Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game is currently the fourth most downloaded free app on iTunes -- and also the No.4 top-grossing one. The company behind it, Glu Mobile, which also owns games such as Deer Hunter and Contract Killer, revealed in a July 30 earnings call that Hollywood generated $1.6 million during its first five days on the market (it came out on June 25, and has taken over countless lives since)."
2014^  This month, Netflix, the world's largest subscription streaming video service, will offer the original series Orange Is the New Black and other programming to six European nations, including Germany and France. It aims to reduce its reliance on the US market and establish global dominance before Time Warner's HBO Go and Amazon.com's Prime Instant Video do. The big question is whether Netflix can navigate rules that shield homegrown media companies and local culture. Shows that play well in one country may not in another, so Netflix will have to localize at least some content, a costly undertaking. Netflix has said it aims to generate as much as 80% of sales outside the US. In the past year, international revenue jumped 85%. To provide overseas customers with exclusive content, Netflix is buying worldwide rights to US television shows, including Fox's Gotham and new episodes of Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul.
2014^  This week Paula Deen capped off a summerlong comeback tour by appearing on the Today show to discuss the scandal over racist slurs that last year nearly destroyed her food and media empire and to explain what she's doing next. The following morning, on Wednesday, Sep 24, Deen threw open the doors to her new digital-only subscription media venture, the Paula Deen Network, which is charging $9.99 for a monthly subscription, or $95.88 for a full year. Throughout it all, Deen shows off the familiar persona she spent decades crafting on air at the Food Network -- Southern, maternal, sassy, and just a little bit crass. Everywhere you look on the new site, Deen is front and center, tossing out catchphrases, frying meat, and cackling wildly. No character overhaul here. She'll need it, because the demographics of that world are against her: Digital video networks tend to cater to (and be consumed by) the young and the cable-less.
2014^  The Walking Dead is a true zombie show: Nearly every viewer becomes infected with the gruesome drama and, in turn, passes the infection to others. Consider Sunday's season premiere, the start of the fifth season of Walking Dead. Nielsen says 17.3 million households tuned into the episode, more than one million more than the show's previous peak, reached at last season's debut installment. What's more, about 11 million of the viewers on Sunday were in the 18-49 age range that so excites advertisers. By some measures, Walking Dead has been the most watched show in cable-television history for two years. It's only getting more popular. AMC Networks acknowledges that online video services have cultivated legions of new fans, many of whom don't pay for cable television and follow the zombie action on Netflix or iTunes.
2014^  Recent weeks have brought a steady stream of established television brands and personalities into the Internet's burgeoning world of direct-to-consumer entertainment networks. The list keeps growing: Glenn Beck, WWE, Paula Deen, and now even the illustrious HBO. CBS joined the digital race on Thursday with the launch of CBS All Access, a subscription-based, video-on-demand network that will allow viewers to binge-watch the broadcaster's programming via Internet-connected devices for $5.99 a month. One key factor driving the television programmers' rush to the Internet is that with each passing year more and more Americans are starting to watch some, if not all, of their television shows online. For home viewers, this means that a la carte online-television menu is about to get a lot more diverse and a lot more tempting.
2014^  As an alternative to election night coverage, HBO will launch The Offseason: Kevin Durant, an hour-long documentary about how last season's National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player spent the summer. The Offseason is part of trend whereby star athletes become their own media wings. No longer content just to play the games and give quotes to reporters, the most sought-after players are now writing first-person stories, running digital media startups, and producing television and online videos. The show is not so much a documentary as an hour-long advertisement.
2014^  For the past three years, 27-year-old Ohio native Jessica Beinecke has scripted, acted in, and recorded about five episodes a week of OMG! Meiyu (OMG! American language) -- her hit Internet program that teaches Chinese students American slang. Beinecke's short, spunky videos quickly went viral on Chinese social media in 2011. This year, Beinecke decided to flip her format and make videos geared toward the growing number of young Americans trying to learn Mandarin. Crazy Fresh Chinese went online in January with sponsorship from the 100,000 Strong Foundation, a Department of State initiative started in early 2013 with the goal of encouraging Americans to study Mandarin. A typical video of OMG! Meiyu or Crazy Fresh Chinese starts with Beinecke acting out a situation and explaining how to use slang.
2014^  Sony is the first company out of the gates with an online television package designed to fully replace a cable subscription. The product, first announced at CES back in January, finally has details and a name: PlayStation Vue. Other attempts at streaming-television services, most notably Intel's OnCue system, were stifled by a failure to strike deals with content companies. Sony already has a deal with Viacom to supply 22 channels, including Nickelodeon, MTV, and Comedy Central. Andrew House, the CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, acknowledges that sports are a must-have. The service will launch on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, and Sony is working on a version for iPads. A year after the PS4 hit the market, many core gamers have already bought consoles, and Sony sees entertainment as a way to goose sales for the next several years.
2014^  DirecTV is launching a Spanish-language streaming service in the US, allowing people to pay $7.99 a month for online access to movies, television shows, and sports in Spanish, even if they don't pay for the company's satellite-television service. DirecTV isn't a complete stranger to online video -- its DirecTV Everywhere platform lets subscribers watch some content on mobile devices and PCs -- but the streaming service hints at the potential for online television products to come. For DirecTV, a major attraction of developing the Spanish-language service, which it calls Yaveo, is to begin building the skills the company will need to get into the broader Internet television business. Starting with a niche service makes sense, in part because mainstream content companies have been suspicious of Internet television.
2015^  The Super Bowl halftime show has become a showcase for some of music's biggest stars in recent years, from Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones to Beyonce, Prince, and Madonna. True to form, this year's broadcast, on February 1 on Comcast's NBC, will feature singer Katy Perry, one of pop music's biggest acts, with an assist by rocker Lenny Kravitz. Yet that star power isn't deterring YouTube from offering its own halftime show online, hosted by Harley Morenstein, the ringleader of food stunt group Epic Meal Time. The show, featuring some of YouTube's biggest stars, is part of a broader initiative to promote ads on the Google-owned site -- as well as to exploit America's cult of loving and hating the expensive ads that air during the Super Bowl, the year's most-watched television event. More than 60 million people subscribe to the channels of the participating creators, some of whom YouTube has promoted on billboards around the US.
2015^  Not long ago, Clint and Wiley Hensley, twin 8-year-old brothers in Silver Spring, MD, made an important discovery. They realized they could use their family's Roku streaming player to watch SpongeBob SquarePants -- Nickelodeon's hit animated television series about a goofs' sponge and his neurotic underwater friends -- over the Internet through Amazon Prime Instant Video. Soon the twins were cycling through episodes until they'd lost count. Clint found Patrick, the dopey starfish, particularly hilarious. SpongeBob SquarePants began airing on Viacom's Nickelodeon in 1999, seven. years before the Hensley twins were born. Since then, significant changes -- the advent of Netflix, the rise of YouTube, the proliferation of DVRs, smartphones, tablets, etc. a -- have upended the home-entertainment market. The rise of on-demand viewing and social media -- SpongeBob has 59 million fans on Facebook -- has only helped drive the character further into viewers' lives. The SpongeBob film is the first from Paramount Pictures' dedicated animated division, which the company launched in 2011.
2015^  It's been a decade since YouTube became the first household name in Internet video. In 2008, at the first NewFronts, an annual online marketing conference, Google-owned YouTube had the overwhelming majority of the viewership. Hulu was new, and Facebook had added videos just the year before. At this year's NewFronts, April 27-May 7 in New York, 34 companies are promoting online shows and vying for ad dollars. While YouTube retains a healthy lead in the $7.8 billion US market for online video ads, it's not keeping pace with rivals' growth. Over the past two years, many production companies that reliably crank out hit videos, some now owned by big media companies, have spread their work to other services.
2015^  At a time when YouTube personalities are being cast in feature films and Vine celebrities are shooting television commercials for Hewlett-Packard, social media stars are attractive to advertisers eager to captivate young eyeballs. YouNow, which the analytics firm App Annie ranks seventh in the US among iOS social networking apps by gross revenue, is a favorite. The company says it logs 100 million user sessions each month, with visitors spending an average of 50 minutes a day, whether broadcasting their own videos or viewing those of others. Unlike YouTube, Vine, and most other amateur-video services, though, YouNow doesn't allow advertising. Instead, it relies on viewers to tip the people who make videos they like, taking a 30% cut for itself. People on YouNow agree to do things in exchange for followers or tips but the culture of the site shuns the exhibitionism-for-hire found on adult sites.
2015^"  As soon as Chad Horstman saw the YouTube video of a rat dragging a slice of pizza in the New York City subway, he knew it should be a Halloween costume. It was just so obvious, says Horstman, 37, founder of the online lingerie and costume store Yandy.com. They try to make things that people are going to instantly recognize, he says. With viral videos, it's pretty easy. Yandy expects $1 million in costume sales this year, about 30% of which will come from ""trend"" costumes -- outfits relevant only in 2015. Today, the more controversial a costume is, the more likely it is to go viral. When that happens, the real benefit for a manufacturer is marketing, not sales revenue."
2015^  Using the screen name KittyPlaysGames, Kristen Valnicek was streaming herself playing death matches in various games, most frequently Counter-Strike, a popular first-person shooter. Fans follow her footage on a Web site called Twitch, which bills itself as a social network for video game fans. Typically, they watch Valnicek in a split-screen format, with her gameplay in one window and a smaller projection of her head and torso, captured via webcam, in another. Twitch, which was launched in 2011 as the side project of a floundering San Francisco startup, has grown into a global vortex of adolescent veneration. Twitch, which Amazon.com acquired in September 2014 for about $970 million, is the front-runner in this growing market, but it faces a serious challenge from a powerful adversary: Google's YouTube. Today, Twitch's headquarters are in an office building in downtown San Francisco. Most of the common areas are tricked out with video-game-inspired decor.
2015^  For a spinoff of Breaking Bad that's meant to be a prequel, Better Call Saul opens in a strange place: the kitchen of a Cinnabon in a Nebraska mall, some time after the closing credits rolled five seasons of the show's forebear. The man behind the counter, sporting a bushy mustache but missing his trademark hairpiece, is Saul Goodman, the crooked defense attorney who played a supporting role on Breaking Bad. Since the days of Laverne &amp; Shirley and Frasier, spinoffs have been a time-honored way for network executives to exploit an established audience. Thanks to Netflix and other online-video services, the audience for Breaking Bad increased over time, with average weekly viewers climbing to 5.4 million the last season, according to Nielsen.
2015^  For more than a decade, pirating a movie or television show using BitTorrent, the Internet's notorious file-sharing protocol, required a modicum of work and technical ability. You had to use a clunky program specially designed to seek out and decode pirated files, then learn to refine its search tools to find the videos you wanted. Annoying banner ads within the search program were part of the deal, as was occasional malware. Pirating wasn't just a pain for the Hollywood studios whose products were being passed freely around the Web; it was a pain for unscrupulous seekers of free video, too. In the past year, a program called Popcorn Time has become the kinder, gentler face of piracy online, taming BitTorrent to make it far more user-friendly and less obviously sketchy. Although it's difficult to estimate total viewership of a pirate service, in Netflix's latest annual report to shareholders CEO Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells named Popcorn Time a major worry.
2015^"  In January the messaging app Snapchat, known mostly for letting its young users share annotated photos that vanish shortly afterward, added a ""Discover"" feature, a menu of free channels from 11 media companies that publish video clips and news stories directly to Snapchat. Two people who work for Snapchat's channel partners say their daily video clips and written stories average more than 1 million viewers. Although it has an obsessive young audience coveted by advertisers that now totals more than 100 million, the app's main content is uniquely ephemeral, and the company says it doesn't track user behavior in the ways most social networks do to sell ads. Snapchat is also selling ads against feeds of short, nondisappearing videos from users, a feature called ""Live"" unveiled last summer. Some Live feeds have drawn more than 30 million viewers, say the three people familiar with Snapchat's viewership."
2015^"  Even for the ""Worst Company in America,"" it's been a rough year. Comcast, the largest US cable provider, got that title -- and the Golden Poo trophy that comes with it -- from Consumerist, the advocacy blog owned by Consumer Reports, in April 2014. Customers surveyed in its hometown of Philadelphia said they regard its service as ""lousy"" or ""non-existent."" In February the company began sending customers personalized online billing videos that explain extra charges such as movie purchases. In March it expanded the team handling customer complaints via Facebook and Twitter from 20 employees to 60. It's testing a smartphone app that lets customers track the location of the technician headed their way."
2015^  From HBO and AMC to ESPN and the Tennis Channel, television networks have relied for decades on cable and satellite providers to distribute their programming. In the era of streaming video, they're trying to deliver shows and movies directly to viewers online, yielding a host of challenges more complex than negotiating fees with the likes of Comcast and DirecTV, says Paul Rehrig, SVP for business development at AMC. To build Shudder, Rehrig hired DramaFever, one of more than two dozen businesses working behind the scenes to set up dedicated online homes for old-school media companies. Some of the new online destinations make their money from ads; others, from subscriptions, like the small packages of streaming television channels out or coming by year-end from Comcast, Verizon, Dish Network, Apple, and Sony.
2015^  As a working mom, Abbie Schiller relied on 30 minutes of television in the morning and the evening to keep her toddler occupied. There was plenty of programming that taught kids to count and spell, but the Los Angeles resident saw a void when it came to social and emotional learning. So Schiller, who was head of public relations for ABC Daytime, improvised. Schiller left ABC in 2007 to focus full time on creating videos and books that help kids cope with strong emotions, like jealousy and anger, and sticky situations, like getting lost. She and her husband, Marc Gordonson, a digital advertising executive, sold their house and moved in with her parents.
2015^  The successful expansion by Netflix into Australia, Canada, Europe, and Latin America over the last five years has increased investor confidence in the streaming service's plan to build the first worldwide, online television network. By the end of 2016, CEO Reed Hastings wants to reach the rest of the globe, a sprint through more than 150 countries across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. That push begins with Netflix's September 2 entry into Japan, home to more broadband households than any of its current markets outside the US. Netflix figures the potential for an on-demand revolution exists, since much of Japan has access to broadband Internet at home, and people routinely watch videos over their mobile phones. The real challenge is to generate excitement in a place that isn't clamoring for Netflix, says Cameron Johnson, company executive working on the Japanese site. Hastings won't give hard numbers, but he's optimistic about Netflix's prospects.
2015^"  Ever since Susan Kare's 8-bit designs graced the first Macintosh screens in 1984, icon design, like digital typography, has been an important if unglamorous niche in the software business. The 2008 debut of Apple's App Store created a sea change in the industry, says Gedeon Maheux, co-founder of Iconfactory, a large design studio in Greensboro, NC, that does work for big brands such as Windows and Twitter. Icons and glyphs -- the term for symbols that blur the line between typography and pictograms, such as the triangular ""play"" button on online videos -- must be drawn for every screen size that Silicon Valley produces, from 5K resolution monitors to smart appliances and wearables. Even the tiniest icons start out big on designers' screens. This isn't merely for convenience while drawing them: Many clients require large-format versions of the icons for use in offline marketing materials. Multiple device resolutions are another issue."
2015^  When Amazon.com, Apple, and Google released updated versions of their streaming devices this fall, all three companies pitched them as a way to play video games on television. Roku is doing the opposite. While discussing the company's strategy shortly before the October 6 release of the Roku 4, CEO Anthony Wood had to be pressed to even mention gaming. Wood said that their attitude on gaming is that it's a feature, not a strategy. Roku has offered some games for years, but the CEO said he doubts his company's hardware or any of its direct competitors will make much headway with hard-core gamers. According to him, his competitors are misjudging the market because of the incredible success of mobile games.
2016^  As competitive gaming grows more popular, the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) is setting the pace. More than 330 million people watched some part of the league's four-week world championships last fall through channels like YouTube and gaming-video site Twitch. Bigger audiences and prizes are drawing a wave of outside investment, setting up a showdown between the league's past and its future. Since the fall, the money coming from outsiders, including veterans of the US pro sports industry, has begun to professionalize the league in ways big and small. The changes have rankled team owners who don't have access to that kind of cash, but the new money is also forcing tough conversations about how to run a pro league in which many players are teens. The arrival, of mainstream investors should make the industry seem safer to big advertisers, says Steve Arhancet, co-owner of the LCS squad Team Liquid, adding that he's unconcerned by the prospect of new money changing the league.
2016^  Lilly Singh, a 27-year-old YouTube personality, has delighted teenagers for six years from the comfort of her couch. With almost 8 million subscribers following Singh's main channel for free, YouTube decided to invest in the Internet star when it heard she was making a documentary, A Trip to Unicorn Island. Google, which bought the video-sharing Web site in 2006 for $1.65 billion, plans to make YouTube more profitable by creating a revenue stream with Red. Like Netflix and Amazon.com, Google is offering original programs, but instead of Hollywood talent, Red is banking on the star power of homegrown personalities such as Singh to persuade fans to sign up.
2016^  Verizon Communications once aspired to be the Comcast of mobile, streaming movies and television shows to its 107 million monthly subscribers. Now it wants to be YouTube, feeding short video clips to millennials, who spend more hours each day glued to the tiny screens of their phones than they spend sitting in front of a television. Verizon's Go90, named after people's tendency to flip their phone sideways to watch movies and videos, premiered as an app for Apple and Android phones in October and is avail able to customers of other carriers. In a move that may tip the playing field, Verizon announced in early February that data usage on Go90 won't count toward customers' caps. Using the trove of information it has collected on its wireless subscribers, including age, gender, general interests, and location, Verizon says it can help marketers flash their ads to the right people at the right time.
2016^  Ryder Carroll is a bike-sharing, glasses-wearing product designer from Brooklyn, NY. Early in March, they met in a crowded coffee shop. No one recognized the 35-year-old, even though he's a cult Internet celebrity: Carroll invented the Bullet Journal system, a method for note-taking and day planning that people who love paper and pens swear by. Carroll's How to Bullet Journal instructional videos have been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube. Devotees make their own videos and post journal photos to Instagram, where a search for #bulletjournal returns more than 66,000 results. Carroll didn't consider promoting his method -- or even naming it -- until he offered help to a co-worker overwhelmed by planning her wedding.
2016^  Suddenly, it seems, the whole world is live-streaming. Thanks to Facebook, Google (YouTube), Amazon.com (Twitch), and Twitter (Periscope), anyone even vaguely interested in broadcasting live video online can figure out how to do it. The sales pitches from these companies are simple: stream first, ask questions later. And as with the heyday of blogging a decade ago, the live-streaming gold rush means there's money for anyone selling shovels. In this case, that translates to the technical hardware, software, and know-how needed to make amateur live video look more professional. One of the early leaders in this growing subset of America's online video ad market is the aptly named Livestream, a Brooklyn, NY, startup that's raised $17 million since its 2007 founding.
2016^  Major league sports teams are recruiting a new kind of player: one who can score with a joystick. In the past two months, Manchester City and West Ham United, two of the top English Premier League soccer teams, have signed professional video gamers to represent the clubs when playing FIFA, a hugely popular Electronic Arts soccer video game. E-sports is now a $500 million industry, according to Deloitte, with a mostly millennial audience. Not long ago, those folks would have been fans of real-life sports; now they may not even subscribe to cable. Instead, they're more likely to interact online through fantasy sports or video games. Signing video players is an extension of the move over the past few years to professionalize e-sports.
2016^  Big media distributors such as AT&amp;T, which owns DirecTV and delivers movies and television shows to 100 million subscribers of its wireless, Internet, and video services, have argued for years over which can best withstand the disruption brought about by online services like Netflix: Content providers? Or cable and satellite operators? With his surprise $85 billion takeover bid for Time Warner, Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T's CEO, is betting that the companies that will thrive in a world of streaming and smartphones must be both. The future of mobile is video, and the future of video is mobile, Stephenson said on October 22 after announcing the deal. Already, AT&amp;T and Time Warner have separately been working to make it easier for consumers to watch more movies and television shows online. Some analysts are skeptical of AT&amp;T's rationale, pointing to Time Warner's disastrous merger with America Online in 2000.
2016^  When NBC and Fox created Hulu 10 years ago, they offered customers something they'd never had before: last night's television shows available over the Internet for free. It presaged the future of television -- online and on-demand, no VCR or DVR required. By the time Mike Hopkins took over as Hulu's CEO in 2013, that early advantage had been mostly squandered. Netflix was laying the groundwork for a global television network, and Amazon.com was about to release a slate of video programs. Now Hopkins hopes his company -- owned by Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Walt Disney, and Time Warner -- can again lead the industry by becoming the first streaming service to couple live television with a wide library of on-demand programs that goes beyond what traditional cable offers.
2017^Snapchat makes things a lot tougher. Armstrong has followers there, too, but he doesn't know exactly how many. And because of the way the service works, it's hard for him to track how many people watch the sponsored messages he sprinkles into his posts. To capture the audience for a recent video for Toyota Motor Co, he had to set an alarm on his iPhone for 23 hours and 59 minutes after the post to remind him to take a screen shot of the number of viewers. He was cutting it close: Like most Snapchat posts, the video disappeared at the 24-hour mark, taking his proof with it. The company doesn't send executives to VidCon, the influencer conference in Anaheim, CA, where Instagram and its corporate parent, Facebook Inc, have a heavy presence. There's no special Snapchat team catering to the pitchmen and no easy way for the influencers to tell how many views they're getting, making it less obvious why the Lexuses of the world should pay them.
2017^  In 2012, Google researchers found a whimsical way to show off the power of the company's artificial intelligence (AI) technology: They trained computers to recognize cats in YouTube videos. The project took years to pull off and required 16,000 computer processors to analyze 10 million images. That type of AI, known as deep learning, now powers Amazon.com's smart speaker Echo and Tesla's self-driving cars. While such software can seem magical, it still typically requires thousands of computers to spend months scanning millions of data points. Ben Vigoda, an MIT-trained computer scientist (and nephew of late actor Abe Vigoda), says he can cut out most of the grunt work and make AI projects doable for businesses without Google-level resources.
2017^"  For years, YouTube has served up almost every imaginable kind of video. The site's top trending attractions on a recent afternoon included clips of a gymnasium roof collapsing in the Czech Republic, a colossal alligator lumbering across a footpath in Florida, some North Korean refugees digging into American barbecue for the first time, and a guy demonstrating how to wash a car with a baby. Now, a dozen years after its creation and about a decade after its absorption into Google Inc, YouTube is on the verge of adding yet one more genre -- a category of programming that has long eluded it. YouTube is finally getting regular television. Subscribers will be able to watch YouTube television on smartphones, tablets, laptop computers - pretty much however they want. The mobile apps are designed to easily ""cast"" from smartphones to larger screens, perhaps even -- for older people -- actual television sets. Throughout the app, native YouTube content will be layered in alongside the network shows."
2017^When Facebook Inc wants to try something new, one of its first calls is to CNN. It was a key partner when Facebook introduced its news-reading app, Paper, in 2014. When the social network shuttered Paper soon after, transmogrifying it into a series of fast-loading News Feed stories called Instant Articles, CNN remained on board. And last year, CNN was one of the few parties to which it paid a nominal fee to produce clips of, say, election results being projected on the Empire State Building. But strain is showing in the relationship. Facebook's latest pitch to publishers such as CNN is for them to provide a regular stream of television-quality, edited, original videos that will give Mark Zuckerberg's company a chance to compete with YouTube and siphon some of the $70 billion pouring into television ads each year. In exchange, the publishers can share some Of the revenue for ads that roll in the middle of the videos. Facebook will control all the ad sales.
2017^As a former tour manager for Bob Dylan and The Band, Jonathan Taplin isn't your typical academic. Lately, though, he's been busy writing somber tomes about market shares, monopolies, and online platforms. His conclusion: Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google have become too big and too powerful and, if not stopped, may need to be broken up. Taplin, 70, author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy, knows digital media, having run the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. Ten years before YouTube, he founded one of the first video-on-demand streaming services. He also knows media M&amp;A as a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in the 1980s. He says Google is as close to a monopoly as the Bell telephone system was in 1956. Taplin suggests that authorities look to 1956, when the US forced Bell Labs to license its patents to all corners. The result
2017^"One evening in June 2016, Isaac Larian lay in bed at his Malibu, CA, home, unable to sleep. So the CEO of the world's largest private toy company, MGA Entertainment Inc, did what any insomniac toy CEO would do to unwind: He watched viral videos of kids unboxing toys on YouTube. Videos by youthful toy reviewers can get millions of views, and watching toys being freed from their packaging has become must-see television for many fans. This year, MGA's newest product, the L.O.L. Big Surprise has landed at the top of many 2017 best toy lists. It sold out at both Toys ""R"" Us and Amazon.com on the first day it went on sale -- again, without a single television spot. To Larian, whose company created such hits as Bratz and Lalaloopsy dolls, the success validates his decision several years ago to shift away from running spots during kids' television and cable programming and instead depend mainly on getting MGA's products into the hands of kid influencers on YouTube."
2017^"""Evil unicorns"" aren't billion-dollar startups gone bad. The term, coined by Google engineers, refers to webpages full of lies about an obscure subject. When there's little other information about the subject online, the lie-stuffed pages get pushed to the top of search results, because the search engine doesn't have much else to show. That's what happened in October, after the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured more than 500. For hours, Google searches about the massacre prominently displayed posts coordinated to falsely identify a Democratic donor critical of Donald Trump as the shooter. Something similar happened in November after the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, TX. YouTube videos and tweets mislabeled the shooter as ""antifa,"" an antifascist protester often willing to use violence. While Google is accustomed to battling spammers and click-bait publishers to maintain the integrity of its search results, it's done less to fight back against the deliberate poisoning of its real-time news and video catalogs."
2017^In the past 25 years the cost of broadcast rights for English Premier League soccer has surged thirty-fold as deep-pocketed media companies have grown to depend on live sports to win subscribers and keep them from defecting to online rivals. Next year an even richer bunch -- those same Internet giants that are wooing television viewers -- will likely show up at rights auctions, pushing prices even higher. Live sports attracts a passionate fan base, Greg Hart, video chief at Amazon.com Inc, said in August after signing a deal to offer Association of Tennis Professionals matches on Prime Video.
