1998^"AOL now dominates cyberspace, and its recent agreement to buy Internet pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. has set the new-media world clucking about the ""C's"" for the coming year. The consensus, based on conversations across the Internet community, is that Mr. Case's three will give way to nine ""C's"" and a ""P"" in 1999: But even if it mauls the mall, electronic commerce faces some ugly facts of the retail world that not even the efficiencies of the Internet can ignore: the difficulty of maintaining margins in vicious price wars, the constant need to feed the marketing machine and the inevitability of competition. Most Internet executives seem positively frantic on this topic: Now that they have gotten your attention, how can they hold on to you? Many say the goal for 1999 will be to increase the number of ""hooks"" online companies can sink into a user. Among them: free e-mail, ""electronic wallets,"" Internet calendars and Web-based date books. That's because, says Julie Wainwright, chief executive officer of Reel.com Inc., an online video seller, many Internet users are still ""samplers."""
1999^Now, in the budding days of online video and tunes, music executives are getting tougher than ever in licensing negotiations. They are trying to prevent MTV from using its TV clout to crush a groundswell of rivals on the Web. Digital technology has spawned numerous music sites, from homegrown fan pages to sophisticated sites backed by the record companies themselves. They let fans listen to music, watch performances and buy tunes via the Web. And record industry executives want to make sure the sites thrive in the new wired world -- before MTV can dominate it. As for the Web, MTV hasn't asked for exclusivity, an MTV spokeswoman says. In some TV licensing renewal talks, however, the company has requested that competing Web sites not get videos any sooner than MTV's cable channel does, a person familiar with the discussions says. The record companies are eagerly signing licensing deals with MTV's Web rivals, executives say, but want richer licensing fees from the Web than those negotiated by MTV for television. The Justice Department began scrutinizing the music-video powerhouse, a unit of Viacom Inc., several months ago. The agency started looking into MTV's competitive practices in television when MTV acquired rival TV channel The Box in a deal with Liberty Digital, a unit of Liberty Media Corp. In addition to bringing a rival into the MTV fold, the deal also beefed up MTV's Web presence by linking its music sites with Liberty Digital's music sites, such as sonicnet.com and streamland.com.
2000^"Currently only a handful of companies offer broadband service. But Jupiter Communications, a New York market-research firm, estimates 2.8 million North American households will have cable modems by year end, with an additional one million or so DSL households. And there is still considerable room for growth: More than 48 million North American homes have cable-modem service available to them, while about half as many homes are within reach of DSL service from Bell Atlantic, SBC Communications and BellSouth Corp. By 2003, Jupiter estimates, 7.7 million households will use cable modems, compared with 5.7 million households for DSL.  Bell Atlantic -- which will become Verizon after its merger with GTE Corp. -- introduced its DSL service in October 1998, beginning in the Pittsburgh and Washington metro areas. By early May, the company had equipped more than 900 of its 2,500 central offices for DSL, and more than 19 million of the 44 million lines in its service area were ready for the service. Bell Atlantic began offering DSL service in New York last July, though the roll-out really gathered speed late last winter. Today, only a handful of the central offices serving the metro area aren't DSL-ready. At the end of May, Bell Atlantic had about 70,000 consumer DSL customers.  Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic and the Baby Bells are working on technological solutions to extend the range of DSL. At the same time, they're looking beyond DSL entirely. Mr. [Jeff Waldhuter] calls DSL ""an interim technology"" that he expects will be around for 15 years -- during which time Bell Atlantic will bring super-fast fiber-optic lines directly to more customers."
2000^Strategic Advantages: Disney acquired Infoseek and created the Go Network Internet portal to try to turn itself into an online competitor of AOL, Yahoo and other Web titans. The Go Network includes key Disney properties like ESPN.com, Disney.com and ABCNEWS.com. Go.com's advantage is the strength of its individual sites. ESPN.com, for example, is the longtime leader in online sports news.
2004^"""The only reason it didn't succeed was broadband,"" says Mark Davis, managing partner of the venture-backed company practice at consultancy Deloitte &amp; Touche, which advised Mibrary. ""It came to the point of saying, 'This idea is just too early.' It would be perfect right now."" The Web casts, provided by Sportsline.com Inc. for a $9.95 subscription and free for AOL's three million high-speed subscribers, may not have been possible as recently as a year ago, says FeedRoom President and Chief Executive Jon Klein. ""We would have had far fewer viewers,"" says Mr. Klein, who in 1998 left his job as a senior executive overseeing CBS's 60 Minutes to start FeedRoom. ""There's now a critical mass of viewers for marketers to reach."" Another dot-com era media start-up company benefiting from the surge in broadband is the NewsMarket, a video-archive and distribution platform that allows the news media to access free broadcast-standard video over the Internet. ""The digital newsroom, [powered by] broadband, is transforming how the broadcast media operates,"" says Anthony Hayward, co-founder and chairman of the NewsMarket. ""Those same technologies are transforming how . . . companies are communicating. We sit right in the middle of that opportunity."""
2005^"Mr. [Jordan Golson]'s site -- at jlgolson.blogspot.com -- is just one of dozens of locations on the Internet hosting amateur videos of the Indian Ocean disaster. Many have been deluged with visitors eager to see more of the gripping footage than TV offers, or to watch videos over and over again on their own time. Some of these ""video blogs,"" like Mr. Golson's, are pre-existing text blogs, which typically include commentary and views on current events. Others have just sprung up in the last week. WaveofDestruction.org, created by an Australian blogger to host tsunami videos, logged 682,366 unique visitors from last Wednesday through Sunday morning, and has more than 25 amateur videos of the impact so far. Last year, video bloggers already showed their muscle by rapidly distributing a clip of singer Ashlee Simpson caught lip synching on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and another of the Daily Show's Jon Stewart clashing with the hosts of CNN's ""Crossfire."" According to Andreas Wacker, founder of blogsnow.com, a site that ranks blogs, the Crossfire video was downloaded by more people on the Internet than saw it on TV. ""When the Internet wants to see something, it sees it,"" he says. Bloggers don't charge for access, but they haven't been paying for copyrighted footage, either. And bloggers seldom ask each other for permission. ""The law really hasn't caught up,"" says Mr. Golson. ""The rule of thumb is you can take stuff as long as you say where you got it from,"" and as long as you don't sell it, he adds."
2005^"All of this is free to anyone with a taste for videos and an idea of where to find them. While many of the major search engines such as Google and Yahoo have video search sections, the results are often cluttered with extraneous material, just as they can be for text searches. It usually makes more sense to look for videos on a Web site that focuses on your topic: Go to a news network's site for the latest videos from the war in Iraq, a music site for the latest video from your favorite artist, a sports site for clips from last night's games, etc. To help you explore the expanding world of online videos, here's a sampling of some good places to start looking: Reuters also serves up a wide selection of video on topics such as world news, business and entertainment at TV.Reuters.com. Its popular ""Oddly Enough"" section offers funny and strange videos, such as a mouse riding a surfboard in Australia, or a man who repairs computers using his feet. Selecting any of the topic ""channels"" on the site's main page -- including ""Top News"" for the latest developments -- allows visitors to scroll through a listing of every video in that section. Video blogging isn't only for the personal or experimental. Some newspapers, such as the Spokesman Review, based in Spokane, Wash., are getting their feet wet with vlogs. As reporter Colin Mulvany explains on the site (SpokesmanReview.com/blogs/video), ""I want to tell stories the local TV news stations, with their breathless reporters, doing live standups of stale stories, fail to do anymore."" His almost daily vlogs touch on ""great little stories that go unnoticed each day,"" such as a profile of a Native American Vietnam veteran, a fire that ruined a local resident's home, and the prerelease party for the newest Harry Potter book."
2005^"""If you launch a channel of any kind and the content is popular, people will sponsor it,"" says a spokesman for for TiVo Inc., which has explored new forms of advertising. ""With vlogs the jury is still out."" For Mr. [Steve Garfield], vlogging is an easy outlet for his creative side. It's unlikely a major network would pick up ""The Carol and Steve Show,"" but the Internet allows him to broadcast his show as much as he wants along with other videos that teach would-be vloggers basic video techniques, as well a show he narrates called ""Vlog Soup"" pointing out his top picks among new vlogs. ""It's part of the democratization of media,"" says Mr. Garfield. ""It gives people the tools to express themselves and be creative in all different ways."""
2006^"IT MIGHT NOT qualify as an art form, but it's a format that's on the rise on the Internet: the fake movie trailer that twists an existing movie into a completely different genre. Through incongruous music and editing tricks, ""Psycho"" appears to be a romantic comedy and ""West Side Story"" looks like a slasher flick. The clips have become calling cards of sorts for artists and editors hoping to get noticed. Patrick De Nicola, a 21-year-old junior at Boston's Emerson College, says he's been fielding emails from television networks and comedy clubs since putting one online two weeks ago."
2006^The explosive growth of Internet video is allowing people not only to find an audience for their amateur productions. Now they can actually earn money from them. San Diego-based Eefoof Inc., launched just over a week ago, shares 50% of its profits from text ads and banner ads with users who upload their own online video clips. Shares are distributed based on the number of hits a particular video receives. Recently launched Panjea.com, operated by Aware Media Inc., shares 50% of revenue from the ads appearing on profile pages to which users can upload their own video and audio files. Users can also sell their content via download at a price they set, in which case they earn 85% of the sale. In May, Blip Networks Inc.'s Blip.TV began giving members half of the ad revenue it earns from the still- photograph and video ads that users can have placed at the end of their videos. Revver affixes an ad frame to the end of a video clip and gives the users 50% of the revenue generated when the ad is clicked on, whether the video is accessed from a Web site, shared across instant-messaging services or emailed between friends. Watching online video, from comedy skits to failed cooking experiments, is fast becoming a favorite Internet amusement. Nearly one-quarter of Internet users watch online video at least once a week, according to the Online Publishers Association. To date, video sites have typically relied on members' good will and boredom to stock up on inventory that is funny, fresh and contagious. Now new sites hope that dangling cash perks before video uploaders will help them win traffic from more established players like YouTube and Google Video while helping creators share in the success of these sites. Using an ad- sharing service doesn't prevent filmmakers from also posting their clips on YouTube. YouTube did not answer repeated requests for comment.
2006^"The two see branching out beyond ""Ninja"" as key to long-term success. ""'Ask a Ninja' was always kind of a proof of concept for us,"" says Mr. Nichols. ""We've looked at others who have been successful but they didn't know how to work with new talent and bring fresh ideas into the fold. Dick Clark makes more money in his sleep producing things than he ever does on camera."" EMMY-NOMINATED PODCASTERS Orrin and Jerry Zucker, ""It s Jerry Time"" itsjerrytime.com The Zucker brothers (no relation to the writer-director brothers behind films such as ""Airplane!"") were among the only amateurs nominated for the first ""iPod Emmy,"" awarded this year to shows made for portable players (AOL won for its ""Live 8 concert broadcasts last summer). Their sitcom-like video podcast uses collage-style animation to recount Jerry's day-to-day exploits. VIDEO PODCAST STARS Kent Nichols and [Douglas Sarine] ""Ask a Ninja,"" askaninja.com Some episodes of this video podcast, which features weekly monologues from a sarcastic ninja character, have had close to 1 million views on YouTube. Made by Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sarine, it regularly tops the iTunes podcast charts, and has inspired dozens of amateurs to make their own ninja tribute videos. They ve recently launched another show, ""Hope is [Emo],"" which stars a young woman and has risen to the top 25 on iTunes in part because of its affiliation with ""Ask a Ninja."""
2006^"Then there is Bree, known as ""lonelygirl15"" on Youtube. She might be everything she appears to be -- a sweet, wide-eyed, intelligent-sounding teenager -- but YouTubers have their doubts. Her videos have been among the most watched and most discussed on YouTube for months now. Many of these exchanges -- posted in a comment section on the site -- center on a picture of famed 20th-century occultist and practitioner of ""black magic"" Aleister Crowley that can be seen hanging on the wall of her room. Is Bree a satanist? YouTubers have even been led to question whether Bree herself isn't someone's invention -- an actress with a script -- and whether her travails are luring viewers in to some darker plot point in the future. The cynicism and skepticism of our age, then, are still there. But watching YouTube is not like watching a polished movie because we don't know where we stand. The result is what one might call interactive entertainment on steroids. Viewers are not only trying to anticipate or even influence the next plot twist within a YouTube auteur's own terms. They are often busily trying to determine whether those terms should be accepted in the first place. One YouTuber has gone so far as to create a character he named ""BreesFather,"" who offers monologues in the guise of Bree's (supposedly) Satan-loving father. Thus he has made himself part of Bree's story, at least as experienced by YouTubers. He's not ""real,"" of course. But whether he's any less real than renetto or Bree herself is hard to tell."
2006^The agreement, to take effect before the end of the year, illustrates YouTube's push to tackle the thorny copyright issues facing it and other sites that allow users to upload video content. YouTube is developing an automated system to digitally identify copyrighted music and video uploaded by its users. It will then give a percentage of revenue from any ads that appear alongside those videos on YouTube's Web site, if their owners have agreements with YouTube and opt for that rather than having the videos removed.
2006^"YouTube's new system is the latest attempt by an online startup to transition from disputed copyright practices to a less-controversial business model. TV and movie companies are just starting to come to grips with how to manage video-sharing technology. There are signs they could be interested in cutting deals: Several TV executives say they have been in talks with YouTube and other video sites about ways to make some content freely available. General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal signed an advertising and content deal with YouTube in June. YouTube's agreement with Warner hinges on a digital system YouTube is developing to identify automatically copyrighted music or other audio, and related video its users upload. The system relies partly on what's known as ""fingerprinting"" -- comparing audio uploaded to the site to unique attributes of copyrighted content it already knows. YouTube's planned system is similar in some respects to one proposed last year by an online music startup, Snocap Inc., which was launched by Shawn Fanning, the founder of Napster. Snocap is seeking to help peer-to-peer music services and other online outlets become legitimate music distributors. YouTube said the audio-identification system could potentially be used to locate non-music content such as video clips from TV shows, and that it could eventually use video-identification technology as well. YouTube currently faces legal challenges. Robert Tur, the owner of Los Angeles News Service, named YouTube in a complaint filed in July in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. He alleges copyright infringement in connection with several videos that were available through YouTube. YouTube has said Mr. Tur's suit is ""without merit."" A similar case, which an adult-entertainment company, Io Group Inc., brought against a video-sharing site, Veoh Networks Inc., in June in U.S. District Court for California's Northern District, makes a similar claim. A ruling against Veoh could potentially set a precedent affecting YouTube."
2006^"Much as with pitching traditional journalists, the key with blogging is to have something to say beyond just ""buy my product."" Mark Hughes, author of ""Buzzmarketing,"" calls this ""story wrapping."" Says Mr. Hughes: ""No one is going to talk about the guy who cleans gutters because there is no inherent story value. But they might talk about the guy who cleans gutters who wears a tuxedo."" It paid off. In recent months, Gopher State Taxi has routinely popped first on Google's sponsored link for core keywords, including: ""Minneapolis, airport, taxi."" Mr. [Kenny Kormendy] says his business has grown to a network of nearly three dozen cabs and he is off welfare. He estimates his total payout to Google is about $175 to $205 monthly, based on how many clicks his ads get. ""People with cellphones on planes can find me,"" he says. ""Almost every time I ask someone, they tell me it was on the Internet. And nine times out of 10 it's from Google. I don't have $50,000 to compete with [bigger taxi companies]. But with what I create off the Internet, I can blow them away."" Beyond that, it's critical to make your Web site search-friendly, or search-optimal, for certain keywords. In the early days, search optimization was largely a matter of inserting enough important keywords into your Web site that it would become visible to search engines. In some cases, this still works. Mr. Hughes, the author of ""Buzzmarketing,"" also does speaking for a living. He wanted to pit himself as a viable alternative for people looking to book Malcolm Gladwell, the best-selling author of ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink."" So Mr. Hughes created a Web page within his own site, buzzmarketing.com, that compares ""Speaker Malcolm Gladwell vs. Business Speaker Mark Hughes."" By using the words ""Malcolm Gladwell speaker"" roughly every 300 words on that page, a link to his comparison is now usually among those that pop up on the first search page of Google when you type the words: ""Malcolm Gladwell speaker."" Soon after that page went up, Mr. Hughes says, he got a $17,000 speaking gig from a company that located him that way. (Says Mr. Gladwell of Mr. Hughes's efforts: ""How could I not be flattered?"")"
2006^"The U.N. has enlisted the star of hugely popular Web video series LonelyGirl15 and other Web video makers to participate in an ad campaign promoting an antipoverty event it plans Sunday. Jessica Lee Rose, the teenage actress who plays ""Bree"" in Lonelygirl15 videos posted on video-sharing Web site YouTube, will reprise the role that made her famous, sitting in a bedroom by herself, talking into a camera. But this time, rather than talking about a boy, ""Bree"" makes a plea for the antipoverty cause. The Lonelygirl's antipoverty video, like those made by other amateur video makers, has been posted on YouTube. The U.N. hopes the videos will spark buzz about its call for people around the world to ""stand up against poverty"" at rallies and other events planned for a 24-hour period Sunday. The online videos are part of a broader ad campaign, designed by WPP Group's ad agency Y&amp;R, also involving television. The ad is the first marketing pitch to make use of the LonelyGirl15 character but it may not be the last, Mr. [Greg Goodfried] said. After being approached by Y&amp;R about two weeks ago, the group agreed to participate in the ad because it was ""a really good cause"" and the issue of poverty ""is something that needs more attention,"" says Ms. Rose, the actress appearing in the ad. Mr. Goodfried says they are open to more marketing alliances but says they wouldn't want to let ""Bree"" become ""overcommercialized."""
2006^"Moreover, [Google]'s huge investment in a site exclusively devoted to video (the YouTube acquisition is the largest in the company's history), is seen as a sign that Google has ambitions to dominate the field of video search much in the way it has done text. That's likely to set off a race among Google's competitors to stake out the market -- often deploying cutting-edge technology that they hope will give them an edge. ""Google's acquisition of YouTube marks a turning point,"" says Tim Tuttle, vice president of AOL Video, who says AOL is now trying to carve out its own niche in the space by searching across as many different sources of video as possible -- not just those it hosts. U.S. Internet users streamed more than seven billion videos in July, according to comScore Networks Inc. MySpace.com captured the largest share, followed by Yahoo and YouTube. But when measured by overall traffic, YouTube holds the top spot, with 46% of visits among the top sites tracked by market researcher Hitwise. ""There is no Google or Yahoo of video search,"" says Brian Haven, an analyst at market researcher Forrester Research. ""But with the content exploding and the momentum so strong, there is no way around it happening."" Other technologies that are still being tested include facial-recognition software and the ability to tag different frames in a clip to help search within videos. People who upload videos have their own complaints. Kevin Nalty, a health-care marketer from Doylestown, Pa., says figuring out which of his videos will show up where is a guessing game because the sites are ""bloated"" with inventory. As a result, the 39-year-old tries to label his videos with as many peripherally related words he can think of, including misspellings. By labeling one recent video documenting his attempt to tape wheels onto his daughter's sneakers with the word ""Healies"" -- a misspelling of ""Heelys,"" the popular sneakers with retractable wheels -- he was able to climb higher in various video- search results."
2006^"""When trying to use any virtual technology in the political space, one still has to remember how people think in the real world. Something that doesn't work in the real world probably won't work just because technology is cool. In 2004, everyone was obsessed with Howard Dean's campaign's Internet strategy. It wasn't a new technology so much as a way to tap into Americans' desire to feel included in the political process. 'What Americans Know' is the definitive text on how to understand the American voter. I often go back and reread this key book for insights into the thought process of the voters."" That said, I don't think the risk is too great. YouTube is far different from Napster or Grokster. The core idea of YouTube is that a user creates a work on their own and then shares it online. The thrust of the business is not to encourage anyone to violate copyright, but rather to create works that they then can distribute online. The business model that YouTube features is a far cry from any of the early music file-sharing businesses. That difference in business model should make a big difference in terms of the copyright risk calculus. MR. [Stan Liebowitz]: Although the purpose of YouTube might be to encourage home-grown creative endeavors, some portion of YouTube files have been pure copyrighted files with no home-grown component, although it appears that YouTube has taken them down when requested."
2006^"It's the next iteration of the burgeoning self-help industry: teaching people the obvious. After the success of do-it-yourself books and TV shows that offer expert advice on everything from baking your own wedding cake to remodeling a four-story home, a number of new Web sites are hoping to make money sticking with the basics. On eHow.com, one of the most popular topics is ""How to Boil an Egg"" -- broken down into six steps of written instructions. Videos at ViewDo.com, launched this summer, address such matters as how to peel and slice an apple. WikiHow.com provides a written tutorial on playing ""Hide and Go Seek."" (Step Three: ""Determine who will be 'It.'. . . Use 'One Potato, Two Potato' or similar method."") In many cases, the obvious is proving popular. On VideoJug, a lesson in ""How to Brush Your Teeth"" ranks well above ""How to Make Chicken Jalfrezi"" on the site's ""Most Viewed"" list. The site's video on ""How to Fold a T-Shirt in Two Seconds"" has been viewed nearly 40,000 times. The current version is a seven-step, 850-word guide, with five ""warnings,"" including one about peanut allergies, and 13 additional ""tips,"" such as ""spread peanut butter on both bread slices"" to prevent a ""jelly breach."""
2006^"""It's such a mess because the [entertainment companies] have all of these valuable assets that are just locked up with so many people who need to sign off on them,"" says YouTube Chief Executive Chad Hurley. ""I don't know what it requires, if the government needs to be involved,"" Mr. Hurley laughs. ""I don't know."" Clips from TV shows present similar copyright challenges. A show such as the hit medical drama ""ER,"" for example, has dozens of rights holders. Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. owns the majority of the show, with co-creators Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton having minority stakes. The studio licenses ""ER"" to General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal, Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System for cable repeats and to local stations for weekend airings. Then there are the actors in every episode and details such as the music, which in most cases is purchased with broadcast rights only. Sorting out this rat's nest can take years. It took NBC Universal more than two years, for example, to clear the rights necessary to make the first two seasons of ""Miami Vice"" available on DVD. YouTube's challenges parallel those stirred up by virtually every new entertainment medium to come along in recent years, including DVDs, digital tracks sold by Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes online music store, satellite radio, cellphone ring tones and online music subscription services. ""It's almost like technology has pushed far beyond the business practices and the law, and now everything needs to kind of catch up,"" says Chris Maxcy, YouTube's business development vice president."
2006^"David Letterman's raw, heartfelt post-9/11 monologue? Removed at the request of CBS. Whatever Mr. [Bill Simmons] billed as ""the second greatest YouTube clip of all-time unless you're a Yankee fan""? Gone -- Major League Baseball's new-media arm objected. The trailer for ""Karate Kid III""? Removed for violating YouTube's terms of use. A clip from the ancient proto-reality-TV show ""Battle of the Network Stars""? Ditto. A clip of great baseball fights from ESPN, Mr. Simmons' employer? Going, going, gone. YouTube is ingenious. It's a pleasure. In some cases it's clearly been a boon for content creators. (Take the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit ""Lazy Sunday,"" an early YouTube favorite now available from NBC, or OK Go's video for ""Here It Goes Again,"" still available on YouTube.) There is genuinely popular material on it that isn't violating copyright, a claim that was hard to believe when made by Napster and its ilk. (Take this quietly haunting clip, seen more than 3.5 million times.) It can be argued that it serves a social good. (The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating two officers for allegedly beating a suspect last summer -- in large part because of a video that's been seen hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube.) Certainly it's become a media force in its own right. (The Republicans might still control the Senate if not for Virginia Sen. George Allen's ""macaca"" remark, widely disseminated on YouTube.) Music videos don't belong on YouTube -- they're entire works of art in their own right, and a market for them exists. (Witness iTunes.) But beyond that, where's the harm? It's risible to suggest that content owners are hurt by videos of teenagers lip-synching to hip-hop songs, that the market for sports DVD is destroyed by fans being allowed to relive a team's great moment, or that artists reusing footage of some famous televised event destroys interest in documentaries. Mr. Letterman's post-9/11 monologue resonates for Mr. Simmons and others five years later -- shouldn't it be available online? I couldn't find it; a CBS spokeswoman said she doesn't think it's available. It should be: It's part of our common culture, along with those big sports moments, bits of televised history and famous TV moments. Isn't there some social value to making these bits of video simply and easily available for anyone and everyone to view, reinterpret and comment on?"
2006^"At issue is the widespread presence of copyright music and video content on MySpace. In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for California's Central District, Vivendi SA's Universal dismisses the frequently used label ""user-generated content"" -- alleging that much of the material on MySpace is stolen from copyright holders. Universal executives have been outraged by the leak. In a recent interview, Antonio Reid, chairman of Universal's Island Def Jam Music Group, said next week's debut of the Jay-Z album would likely be ""devastated"" by the leaks. ""I'm sure it's cut into our sales, and not by a small amount,"" Mr. Reid said. ""Even if it [sells] a million units it's not what it should have been."""
2006^"Comedy Central, part of MTV Networks, has bought the TV and digital rights to the animated series, ""Lil' Bush: Resident of the United States,"" and will co-produce it with Amp'd Mobile and the show's creator Donick Cary, a TV writer who has written for ""Late Show with David Letterman"" and ""The Simpsons."" Comedy Central plans to air the half-hour show weekly beginning next summer during the popular 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. time slot, possibly right after ""South Park"" and before ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."" ""Lil' Bush"" will no doubt raise the profile of Amp'd. Comedy Central, however, says its decision to air ""Lil' Bush"" wasn't influenced by MTV Networks' ownership in Amp'd or Messrs. Messrs. [Phillippe Dauman]'s and [Thomas Dooley]'s past investment in the carrier. ""Washington is like a school yard,"" full of petty and juvenile behavior, says Mr. Cary, whose studio in Bulgaria does the animation work. Mr. Cary presented clips of ""Lil' Bush"" to Comedy Central while producing another show for the channel called ""The Naked Trucker and T-Bones"" that's scheduled to air in January."
2006^"Teenagers have begun posting audition tapes on YouTube and MySpace for a series called ""The New 22,"" which its creator, production company Evolution Entertainment describes as a younger version of ""The View."" The casting call was placed through koldCast.com, a new site launched by Irvine, Calif., product-placement company EMmerzion Worldwide to let actors post online auditions. In exchange, the company gets dibs on selling product placements in movies and TV shows that use actors found through the service. Jessie Bronfman, a 25-year-old Woodmere, N.Y., resident who wants to be a TV host, has applied online for a video-jockey position and is hoping to score a role in ""The New 22."" She spends at least an hour a day searching for new online auditions through Craigslist, YouTube and Google, then cultivates her online network of friends who vote for her in video contests and help her get higher ""hit counts"" for audition videos."
2006^"For advertisers, Web television delivers a dream audience of dedicated fans. ""The fact they've gone and sought it out [online] indicates they're pretty loyal, passionate viewers of a show,"" says Mark Simmons, national manager of advertising strategy and media for Toyota, which advertises on many of Disney's online shows. ""It's a step beyond appointment viewing."" Toyota says it's too early to tell how the online shows will affect the company's relationship with Disney, or its regular TV advertising. The car maker also won't disclose what it's paying for the online ads. Disney hasn't set regular rates for the shows, but they are likely to be considerably less than the $550,000 to $650,000 the network charges for a 30-second ad on the broadcast version of ""Lost"" or ""Desperate Housewives."" Fans make the same argument. For instance, an avid viewer of the mystery series ""Veronica Mars"" has created an interactive map showing locations from the program. Why? ""It's another way of generating publicity for 'Veronica Mars,' and we're constantly on the bubble in terms of ratings,"" says the map's creator, a 40-year-old college professor who prefers that her name not be used."
2006^"New York -- EVERYBODY'S TALKING about YouTube -- and not always nicely, either. Doug Morris, who runs Universal Music, gave a speech the other day in which he proclaimed that the 19-month-old online video-sharing Web site owes his conglomerate ""tens of millions of dollars"" for allowing copyrighted music videos to be posted without permission. Mr. Morris's shot across the bow was quickly followed by the announcement that Warner Music, Universal's smarter competitor, has struck a deal allowing YouTube, which receives 100 million hits a day, to show its videos in return for a chunk of ad revenue. Says Warner Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr.: ""Consumer-empowering destinations like YouTube have created a two-way dialogue that will transform entertainment and media."" In recent months, jazz-loving friends have been sending me YouTube links to videos by Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and other celebrated artists, most of them drawn from films of the '30s and '40s and TV shows of the '50s and '60s. Some of this material is available on DVD, but most of it lingered in limbo until Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, YouTube's co-founders, made it possible for anyone with a computer to post and view video clips at will. Fascinated by the links unearthed by my friends, I spent the better part of a long weekend trolling through YouTube in search of similar material. When I was done, I'd found hundreds of videos, some extremely rare and all compulsively watchable, posted by collectors from all over the world."
2007^The first devices for moving Internet content to TVs from PCs, sometimes called media adapters, haven't sold well so far. PCs adapted for playing downloaded videos on TVs also haven't made much headway, despite the high-profile backing of Intel Corp., under an initiative called Viiv. Rivals, by contrast, see Web-delivered video as a way to neutralize the cable industry's ability to deliver video on demand. AT&amp;T Inc., for example, at the CES plans to show the latest version of Homezone, a combined satellite-TV and Internet-video service introduced last year. It offers a set-top box that receives EchoStar Communications Corp.'s Dish Network service and downloads video content off the Web. DirecTV Group, another large U.S. satellite-TV operator, has developed a high-definition set-top box that allows subscribers to retrieve photos and music from computers using Viiv technology. Sony Corp. allows users of the PlayStation 3 to do the same thing, though with a shorter menu. Users now can only get trailers and game demo movies from its so-called PlayStation Store on the Web. But the new game console comes with a browser that allows people to roam to sites such as YouTube and watch its videos on TV. Nintendo Co.'s Wii device can also surf the Web for videos or other content, but the company hasn't emphasized that particular use.
2007^"The online show, called ""News at Seven,"" uses an automated computer program to comb online news outlets for major stories of the day and to pair them with video and still photos culled from sites like Google Images and YouTube. The newscast is delivered by an avatar -- a digital representation of a person."
2007^"One late afternoon last week, seven writers and editors were slouched around the writing-room at CollegeHumor.com's Manhattan office, bouncing around ideas for their next original online comedy video short. ""A meat-based poker game called High Steaks Poker?"" one chimes. Lame, is the collective verdict. A ""Miami Vice""-inspired re- enactment of the game ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"" Bingo. CollegeHumor's expansion into video programming is a harbinger for what Barry Diller's IAC has in store for the rest of its Internet media conglomerate, a portfolio of some 65 brands. While user- generated content, from pet-tricks to video rants, has captured much of the buzz around video online to date, Mr. Diller is betting on a different formula: featuring professionally produced, ad-supported video clips geared toward highly targeted audiences. In addition to kicking off CollegeHumor's original content, Mr. Diller is launching 23/6, a multimedia comedy news site whose name is a spoof on the phrase ""24/7."" He's also adding original online-only content to HSN.com, the home shopping network Web site. That's not stopping Mr. Diller from making an aggressive push into an area he knows well. IAC's president of programming, Michael Jackson, poached some TV talent to run 23/6, which is a partnership with the Huffington Post, a left-leaning news and opinion site. The site, with a launch planned for March, will be edited by Daley Haggar, a comedian and writer who has worked on shows like Comedy Central's ""South Park"" and NBC's ""The Apprentice."""
2007^In a demonstration, ScanScout's system displayed an ad for a sports- car brand at the bottom of a video clip as the people on screen were discussing that type of car. Consumers can click on the ad to pause the playback and see a video commercial, or be taken to the advertiser's Web site. By analyzing a video's content, ScanScout can help companies steer clear of subject matter and language that make them uncomfortable, potentially increasing the confidence of traditional advertisers in buying ads on amateur videos. It can also place multiple ads on a given video clip as what is being discussed changes, something that could let Internet companies tap additional ad dollars. ScanScout is already gaining some traction with customers. Online video site PureVideo Networks Inc. of El Segundo, Calif., says it plans to begin testing ScanScout, probably with standup comedy videos on its StupidVideos.com site. Blip Networks Inc. of New York has tested ScanScout on its blip.tv video site since the fall, and Chief Executive Mike Hudack says he believes it is more effective than just matching ads with the descriptive information the videos' creators supply. ScanScout co-founder and President Waikit Lau says his company lets advertisers pick categories of videos they want to target, in addition to having their ads appear alongside specific key words. He says ScanScout will at least initially tap nonvideo ads, such as graphical and text ads, to appear alongside videos to compensate for any shortage of video advertisements. And Mr. Lau says Web sites can run their high-priced ads as well as the ones from ScanScout, since its ads appear only intermittently during the clips.
2007^"HOW TO FIND IT: On YouTube.com, search for ""Nosferatu rescore"" for ""Nosferatu,"" ""Voyage threetails"" for ""Le Voyage Dans la Lune"" and ""JynxHauser"" for Ms. [Jessica Schreiber]'s videos. ""Nosferatu,"" the 1922 Muranu vampire classic, is one of the most frequently re-scored by professionals and amateurs alike. The most interesting amateur ""Nosferatu"" rescoring on YouTube is a series that adds sound effects -- footfalls, a creaking coffin lid -- and a modern-classical score that includes synthesizers and the occasional electric-guitar chord. The result prompts viewers to watch the clips as they would a modern horror movie."
2007^"Such systems aren't foolproof, though. A recent search with the keywords ""[Britney Spears] and Paris"" turned up a video on Revver purporting to show ""Paris Hilton nude on the beach in st tropez."" The short clip didn't include any video of the celebrity heiress. In fact, it was an otherwise blank screen with a bit of text; alongside the video box was a description consisting of about 200 misleading keywords ranging from sexually explicit terms to ""ESPN"" and ""Microsoft."" After the 28-second clip, there suddenly appeared an ad for a Palm Inc. product. ""This is totally misleading,"" acknowledged Revver's founder and chief executive, Steven Starr. But ""this happens very, very infrequently,"" he added. Revver removed the clip yesterday after a reporter for this newspaper pointed it out. A Palm spokeswoman said she ""contacted Revver to express our surprise and displeasure, and clearly Palm and Revver agreed that the content was inappropriate."" A clip titled ""Hot Blonde Tells You How She Wants to . . .,"" which directed users to a site telling ""How to Make Buckets of Cash"" had garnered almost 500,000 views by yesterday and ascended to the No. 6 slot on the ""Top 10"" list featured on Google Video. The video's creator attached more than 100 misleading keywords, including sexually explicit terms and ""Harry Potter."" It Is possible that some users were actually interested in seeing the site's pitchwoman, but it Is likely that others were misled into watching it."
2007^"IN THE LATEST sign of the influence of YouTube-style videos, Steven Bochco, the creator of hit TV shows like ""L.A. Law"" and ""NYPD Blue,"" is trying a new medium with a series of short, unscripted videos on the Web. Many of the anecdotes have sexual themes, including an entire category devoted to ""my first time,"" and sometimes feature off-color jokes and commentary. Mr. Bochco says he was looking for a topic that young people would be ""universally attracted to."" ""It's the antithesis of what I'm doing in my day job,"" Mr. Bochco says. ""It's just challenging to try and figure out in a different medium, that really has a different expectation."""
2007^"The first episodes harken back to proven hits, from the high-school melodrama of Fox's ""The O.C."" to the typecasting of the horror movie ""Scream."" A more direct precedent might be Lonelygirl15, the extremely popular YouTube personality who seemed to hint at an eerie family backstory in her bedroom videos (which turned out to be concocted by a pair of filmmakers). ""Prom Queen"" gets off to a provocative start. A young woman wakes up in the grass, distraught and in her underwear. Inside, she contemplates a handful of pills and discovers a video camera in her bedroom. When she says ""Oh, God,"" her British accent comes as a surprise -- until we learn, in episode two, that she's an exchange student who is fascinated by the prom."
2007^"CBS could announce as early as today agreements which will make available to these portals previously aired full episodes of shows such as ""NCIS,"" ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" the ""Evening News with Katie Couric"" and certain sports programming. Aside from MSN, a unit of Microsoft Corp., and AOL, a unit of Time Warner Inc., the New York media company is also expected to announce an agreement with Joost, an online-video service founded by the creators of the Internet-telephone service Skype. CBS will become the first broadcast network to sign with Joost. CBS's increased distribution could give it ammunition if it tries to negotiate a favorable deal with YouTube, the biggest video site on the Web with more than one billion videos streamed each month. CBS has tried to strike a broad, multiyear licensing deal with YouTube, but talks have fallen apart over such matters as licensing fees and the forcefulness of YouTube's efforts to police pirated clips."
2007^"The video blog ""Rocketboom,"" for instance, has been delivering three-minute news programs five days a week since October 2004. ""Grammar Girl,"" a popular podcast about proper language usage, gets an update every Thursday like clockwork. That regular schedule is crucial to the podcast's creator, Mignon Fogarty. ""When the shows I listen to don't come out, I get very frustrated,"" she says. Now Ms. Fogarty is exploring new niches. In addition to her own show, she now produces six other advice podcasts featuring other people -- including ""Mighty Mommy,"" about parenting, ""Money Girl,"" about finances, and ""Legal Lad,"" about the law. The network gets about a million downloads a month. Much slicker looking is the video podcast ""Ask a Ninja."" In each episode, a black-clad performer uses questions from viewers to launch comic riffs on the legendary Japanese assassins. In a recent show, a viewer asked, ""Do ninjas write poetry or are they just murderous shadows of death put on earth only to act against mankind?"" Answer: ""Wow, I didn't realize those were the only two options."""
2007^"""We're trying to keep our character palate as balanced as possible,"" says 29-year-old Eric Socolofsky, leader of the three-man creative team behind the site, which he calls a hobby. The unrefined visual aesthetic is meant to have a ""clip art"" sensibility, he says, drawing inspiration from popular online comics like ""Get Your War On"" and ""Red Meat."" Their goal, in part, was to manufacture a new user-generated Internet trend. ""I wanted to try working on a viral Web project,"" says 27-year-old Mr. [Ahmad Saeed], who designed the Quickcomic database. For Mr. Socolofsky, who thought up the concept, Quickcomic is a tool for expression. ""I've taken part in protests, both physically and digitally,"" he says, although these experiences often left him feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. With Quickcomic, Mr. Socolofscy envisioned something ""a bit lighter, a bit humorous and a bit more approachable."" Despite this political aim, early comic creators haven't focused exclusively on political topics. ""I'd say we mostly see people being ridiculous and apolitical,"" says Mr. Socolofsky of the more than 600 comics on the site so far. ""Of the rest, I'd say it leans to the left. But we don't encourage people to express one kind of political view or another."""
2007^"The clips, which run up to 60 seconds long, will assemble memorable moments from the movies, grouped under categories like ""Leia Confronts Vader"" and ""The Lost Limbs"" -- the latter a collection of various characters' limbs getting the chop. One category devoted to a much- maligned lizard-like character from the three ""Star Wars"" prequels urges fans: ""Don't be shy. Here's your chance to edit Jar Jar."" That notion may not resonate with fans who remember Mr. [George Lucas]'s reactions to other attempts to draw on his movies for inspiration. Last year, Lucasfilm sued a Maryland company that was making ""Star Wars""-like light sabers without the proper trademarks. Previously, it sued rapper Dr. Dre for using the booming sound effect that begins Lucasfilm movies to kick off his album ""2001."" And it also sued to block distribution of an animated pornographic movie called ""Starballz"" that featured some ""Star Wars""-like characters. The company says this situation is different. If fans are using ""Star Wars"" material for fun, that's one thing. ""If someone tries to commercialize it, that's where we've drawn the line,"" says Mr. [Jeffrey Ulin]. He says the company has long supported activities like an annual contest for the best ""Star Wars"" movie submitted by a fan; Mr. Lucas will pick this year's winner on Sunday at the ""Celebration IV"" ""Star Wars"" convention in Los Angeles."
2007^"In recent weeks, Universal Pictures has posted several deleted scenes from the comedy online, advertising ""restricted clips"" in Web ads and the bonus material on television, too. Since then, the clips have racked up more than one million viewings combined on the film's official Web site and YouTube, where fans have copied and traded the clips. One scene, in which a ""Knocked Up"" character elaborately details his desire for more graphic sex between male actors in the movie ""Brokeback Mountain,"" has been viewed at least 493,000 times on YouTube. ""Knocked Up"" has already earned at least $73 million in U.S. tickets, more than any other R-rated comedy since Twentieth Century Fox's ""Borat."" For a circle of comedy writers and actors that includes Mr. Ferrell and ""Knocked Up"" director Judd Apatow, the allure of online comedy is hard to resist. Universal has quietly allowed more leaked material intended for the ""Knocked Up"" DVD to appear on the humor-video site funnyordie.com, founded by Mr. Ferrell and director Adam McKay. The scenes, in which ""Arrested Development"" actor Michael Cera and ""Spider-Man"" hunk James Franco (from Mr. Apatow's cult-favorite TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"") get into screaming matches with the director on the set of ""Knocked Up,"" were filmed as part of a mock documentary that Universal says it plans to include in a re-edited form on the DVD. Thus far, viewers have watched the clips more than 409,000 times, according to funnyordie.com. On Tuesday, the band's coming out with its sixth studio album, ""Icky Thump,"" available for streaming at theleak.mtv.com. Reviewers have lauded the title track's ""huge dinosaur-rock riffage"" and the band's return to more sonic experimentation. But the album also represents a commercial test: The color-coordinated pair's last studio release, ""Get Behind Me Satan,"" sold fewer than half as many copies as its previous effort, according to Nielsen SoundScan."
2007^"Google Inc.'s YouTube has become the top video-sharing site with millions of offbeat user-created videos, emerging hit series like LonelyGirl15 -- and untold numbers of illegally posted television and movie clips. Earlier this year, Viacom Inc., the parent of Comedy Central and MTV, sued Google, accusing the search giant of copyright infringement ""on a huge scale"" over the vast hoard of Viacom clips that users have uploaded to YouTube. Google has countered that it is protected by provisions of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which shields Internet companies from liability for copyright infringements by their users if the companies act promptly to remove the clips. Kara Swisher talked with Philippe Dauman, Viacom's president and CEO, and Walt Mossberg spoke with Google Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Schmidt about the lawsuit. MR. DAUMAN: Well, it's a very imperfect system. After we started sending take-down notices, the week before the lawsuit was filed, do you know what was the No. 1 clip on YouTube? It was a South Park clip. Now in the meantime we're making our content available everywhere. We have today over 200 sites. We'll probably have over 1,000 a year from now. We want to be everywhere. We'd love to be eventually on YouTube. MR. DAUMAN: I think consumers will find great content wherever it is. If they want it, they'll find it on our sites, they'll find it on Yahoo. They'll find it everywhere. Consumers will gravitate toward high-quality content. Yes, user-generated content's great, TV shows are great, movies are great. People want a variety of things. We're focused on what we do best."
2007^To help recoup some of their expenses, they made an arrangement with YouTube to show the entire film (the normal limit is 10 minutes), and struck an agreement with Spout.com, a movie recommendation site. For every new member that joins Spout by following a link on the film's YouTube page, Spout will give the filmmakers $1. So far, they say they have made more than $30,000.
2007^60Frames will provide professional video creators with financing for their projects, secure advertising to appear alongside the clips, and distribute the videos online through video-sharing sites and other Internet-based services. The company plans to focus on short-form content, including serialized sketch comedies. Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen will be the first video creators 60Frames works with.
2007^"With ""KateModern,"" however, the creators aren't trying to hide the fact that a professional team is behind the scenes. Among the ""friends"" listed on the character Kate's Web page, there's a link to ""KateModern Production."""
2007^"TV SHOWS from ""Will &amp; Grace"" to ""ER"" have broadcast live episodes to pump up ratings. Now that strategy has come to the Web with a new drama streaming live in prime time. Producer Kathryn Jones says that, until now, live content on the Web has been limited to ""some sports, some politicians, and a lot of people at desks with microphones."" Ms. Jones, who also stars in ""35,"" says the creators wanted to mix the accessibility of Web TV with the spontaneity of theater."
2007^"""Cognizance"" is one of hundreds of movies known as ""brickfilms"" that are getting attention on YouTube and other video-sharing sites. Amateur filmmakers use Lego pieces to create characters and scenes, sometimes spending months painstakingly arranging and rearranging the blocks before the camera. Re-creations of famous moments in ""Star Wars"" and ""Titanic,"" faithfully rendered in the primary colors of Lego pieces and stitched together from thousands of stop-motion frames, have drawn hundreds of thousands of viewings. Many of the productions are original films with elaborate plotlines, soundtracks and voice- overs. ""I was still in junior high, playing with Legos, and the Internet and I collided,"" says Robinson Wood, 18, of San Jose, Calif., whose ""Frankenstein"" and ""Grace"" are often cited by fans as classic brickfilms. In Mr. Wood's plastic retelling of Mary Shelley's monster tale -- which some viewers have found too violent for a film made from children's toys -- he used red clay to simulate blood, and achieved the sound of breaking glass by dropping a peanut butter jar eight feet onto concrete. As brickfilmers try to one-up one another with increasingly creative special effects, they find themselves drawing from an unusual list of household items. Artists realized that they could simulate shattered glass by slowly cutting apart plastic wrap, or a clear sheet of sugar. In Lewis Chen's ""Repent,"" one shootout briefly goes into ""bullet time,"" a slow-motion effect made popular in the movie ""The Matrix,"" in which a character floats through the air while dodging enemy fire. The 21-year-old Arcadia, Calif., college student says his 15-minute film took him six months to make."
2007^Google Inc.'s YouTube said it will expand a pilot program to put advertising in its online videos, giving more users a shot to make money from their homemade videos.
2007^"Three of his favorite shows -- ""The O.C."" on Fox, ""Scrubs"" on NBC and ""Grey's Anatomy"" on ABC -- all aired on Thursday at 9 p.m. this past fall. So Mr. [Adan Canizales], a New York University law student, devised an elaborate solution. He watched ""The O.C."" on TV and recorded ""Scrubs"" on his TiVo digital video recorder. But since his TiVo can't record two shows at once, he later opened his laptop to watch ""Grey's Anatomy"" online. Fox: Fox on Demand introduced free, ad-supported shows this fall to its www.myspace.com/fox page and on MyFoxLocal station sites in 24 markets. Viewers can stream previously aired episodes of eight shows, including ""Prison Break"" and ""Bones,"" which are updated after their TV broadcast. Some popular shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""House"" aren't available, although a seven-minute preview of ""The Simpsons"" drew 1.4 million hits over three days in September. The MySpace site also provides interactive options, with links to the show's official site. NBC: Full episodes of six NBC shows, including ""30 Rock"" and ""Friday Night Lights,"" are accessible on its NBC Rewind video-streaming site at www.nbc.com/Video/rewind/. Like the other networks, shows are divided into segments by nonskippable ads. Every full episode is available for some shows, such as ""Heroes."" But some of NBC's most popular series, such as ""The Office,"" ""Scrubs"" and ""E.R.,"" aren't offered, other than in two-minute replays."
2007^"Mr. [Eric Schmidt] said the Internet giant continues to pursue deals that will let it show media companies' copyright content on YouTube but said there is a ""genuine disagreement."" Traditional media argue their content has a certain intrinsic value, while [Google] says ""prove it,"" he said, speaking at a Bear Stearns investor conference yesterday. ""That's often a difficult conversation."""
2007^"Another big marketer that was reported as cutting spending on measured media was Johnson &amp; Johnson, down 20% overall. Much of the cut occurred in J&amp;J's national TV budget -- which accounts for 60% of the company's total ad spending. The national TV budget was down 25%, or $254 million, while ""measured"" Web spending rose slightly. The TV cutback follows J&amp;J's decision last year to sit out the ""upfront"" TV ad-sales market -- where networks sell most of their ad inventory. J&amp;J said this week it planned to sit out this year's upfront as well. ""As a matter of policy we do not comment on ad spending,"" a spokesman for J&amp;J says. Cable's overall slowdown also reflects a shift of marketers to newer media, media buyers say. Advertisers looking for niche or high-profile audiences such as young men ""were the first to migrate to cable and now those advertisers are moving from cable and broadcast to the Internet,"" says John Spiropoulos, vice president, group research director at Publicis Groupe's MediaVest. ""You can take some money from cable and get a similar reach from the Internet."" TNS's report also is likely to confirm some viewers' suspicions about the amount of product placement -- particularly in reality shows such as Fox's ""American Idol"" and NBC's ""The Biggest Loser."" TNS estimated that in an hour of a reality show, 55% of the time would be taken up either by commercials or by program scenes that included appearances by different brands. Judges on ""American Idol,"" for instance, drink from cups marked prominently with the name of show sponsor Coke."
2007^"The fight began to brew last year, when the West coast ATAS began handing out ""broadband Emmys."" The Los Angeles group objected that one nominee was a version of the prime-time show ""24"" made for cellphones, called a ""mobisode."" That's a prime-time show, ATAS argued. East coast NATAS retorted: On the Internet, what's prime time? On Friday, March 16, the Los Angeles group's attorney George Hedges sent an email proposing that the two groups should agree to a ""mutual standstill"" on any new Emmy award ceremonies. ""The proposed standstill would apply to any ongoing or new projects involving new media content (including MySpace etc.),"" wrote Mr. Hedges, of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver &amp; Hedges LLP in Los Angeles. ""Both organizations have as a goal the working out a system to give Emmy awards for appropriate broadband programming,"" Dixon Dern, general counsel for the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Science. ""But for the West Coast to agree to that, we have to know that the Emmy will be protected."""
2007^"Jason Martell, a 25-year-old self-described political junkie in Lena, Wis., is using MySpace to try to contact presidential candidates about a plan he has posted on his MySpace page for reducing energy consumption. Last week, he posted a note in the comments section of Mrs. [Hillary Clinton]'s MySpace page urging people -- Mrs. Clinton included -- to check out the plan. Mr. Martell, who is unemployed, also has sent personal notes to ""friends"" of Mrs. Clinton's on MySpace, asking them to pass his plan on to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Martell, who hasn't heard back from Mrs. Clinton or her campaign, doesn't think the candidates' MySpace pages are substantively different from, say, their own campaign Web sites. ""I think they're just advertising themselves,"" he says. Still, he says he thinks the pages nonetheless improve his chances of getting his message across to Mrs. Clinton and other candidates. YouTube and other Web sites say they don't plan to stop users from posting negative videos or comments. ""There's going to be a degree of unpredictability"" on the Internet, says Jordan Hoffner, YouTube's director of content partnerships. ""That's the nature of the medium we're in."""
2007^"While newspapers have had success building heavily trafficked Web sites, ""people still don't automatically think to visit a TV-station Web site,"" says Brent Magid, chief executive officer of media consultancy Frank Magid Associates Inc. ""Stations need to do something online to get noticed."" WITN, a Greenville, N.C., station owned by Gray Television Group Inc., is hosting video tours of houses for sale on its Web site, while Nashville's WKRN, owned by Young Broadcasting Inc., started blogs on everything from religion to hunting. Meredith Corp.'s WNEM in Flint, Mich., produced a whole program -- a type of senior-citizen talent show, including a voting element a la ""American Idol"" -- for its site. Prompting station executives to shift to an ""always on"" mentality -- breaking news on the Web around the clock -- has been hard, says Jonathan Leess, president of CBS Stations Digital Media Group.""They needed to understand that this is a threat,"" he says. ""If they continued with a holding-back approach it will severely limit their growth."""
2007^"""Every e-commerce company today is a new-media company tomorrow,"" says John Textor, chief executive of Baby Universe Inc., which recently launched video, accompanied by display ads, on its Web site. He says cost pressures are eroding online retailers' traditional fear that display ads will distract users there to shop. ""Advertising margins are considerably stronger than e-commerce margins."" For other sites, video offers a chance to engage and entertain shoppers. Liberty Media's BuyCostumes.tv features more than 100 clips of costume-clad models, both kids and adults, walking across a stage at a local studio. Two hosts comment on topics like how a superhero's removable mask makes his costume a sensible choice for a party where food will be served. The site will soon launch a feature that allows users to upload their own costume commentaries as well, hoping the feature will generate interest and repeat sales. ""Video helps us convey that jewelry is like a haute-couture dress,"" says Shmuel Gniwisch, chief executive of Ice.com. ""We want people to feel like they are buying a lifestyle."""
2007^"Take General Electric's ""ecomagination"" campaign promoting the company's green energy and technology initiatives. Web surfers who checked out AOL News, Yahoo News or MSNBC.com on the afternoon of May 24 saw a live video featuring GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at a ""Green is Universal"" news conference discussing energy issues. The video played on 95,000 people's computers, and even though it was appearing on news sites, it clearly wasn't a news story. It was part of an ad. GE is one of a growing number of marketers to use videos of live events to spice up banner ads. ""We're always trying to do something a little more innovative and entertaining and be more influential,"" says Jen Walsh, digital media director for GE. ""Year over year we try to push the envelope with technology, content and design. Broadcasting [online video through an ad] achieves that."" To be sure, some marketers question whether redesigning the banner ad is worth it. The ads might temporarily catch a Web surfer's eye because people haven't yet trained themselves to ignore them, but could easily fall into ranks of yet another ignored banner ad or a hated pop-up, says Greg Verdino, chief strategy officer at independently owned new-media marketing firm crayon. ""I think the first natural inclination for advertisers and agencies is for them to innovate within the four walls of the space that they've been given before you look to innovate by breaking that space and doing something that's truly first to the market,"" Mr. Verdino says."
2007^"In a video posted on Superpages.com for Kent Floral in Kent, Wash., the camera pans a flower shop where a baby holds a yellow flower and an announcer declares, ""We're not your typical dot-com florist."" Lora Cree, the shop's owner, said she bought the video ad to let customers know her store wasn't simply an order-taking service. The video was made by a crew hired by Superpages.com; she had some input on the content. At the same time, advertisers have to be careful that they don't hurt business with ads that look too cheesy. Some directory businesses hire videographers who try to steer advertisers away from content that might turn off consumers. But it doesn't always work. Some of the ads look like snippets of infomercials with shots of cheery employees answering phones at a beauty salon, for example. Directory companies try to avoid problems by screening ads to make sure they're G-rated and include basic information about businesses. ""The ad shows customers the quality we deliver,"" said Mr. [Achmar]. ""And once they see the video they don't have to go further browsing through the Web site or have to do any reading anymore."""
2007^"""There's a huge lack of high-quality inventory to sponsor,"" says Michael Shehan, chief executive officer of online video-ad network SpotXchange, a unit of Booyah Networks, which has run ads for the film ""1408"" and for companies like SunTrust Banks on Voxant's network of niche Web sites. Voxant has a team of researchers who spend much of their time searching for obscure Web sites in areas like sports, entertainment, news, health and business. It has a separate team of people who monitor those sites for offensive language or images. Sites that violate Voxant's decency policies, or those of its clients, are quickly pulled off the roster, says Voxant CEO, Jeffrey Crigler. A handful of companies are trying to fill the middleman function that Voxant provides. But the Reston, Va., company is one of the few that has struck deals with about 230 publishers including the AP, BBC and The Wall Street Journal, a unit of Dow Jones. When a Web site decides to embed a news story from Voxant, Voxant and the news provider each receive 40% of the revenue; the Web site receives the other 20%."
2007^"A new crop of Web entertainment sites has popped up in recent months, many of them featuring scripted, episodic short-form content known as ""webisodes."" The online offerings include Web sites that feature video shorts, such as Break.com; scripted original series such as ""quarterlife,"" a 36-episode series from top TV producers Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, known for the series ""thirtysomething""; and ""Prom Queen,"" the Web-only drama produced by former Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner. One of Break's most popular shows is a series it licensed from General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal unit called ""Hot Crush"" featuring two young women breaking things.

While that series doesn't run with advertising pre- or post-clip, the site overall is dotted with ads for a coming Sony movie, ""Walk Hard,"" and the TBS show ""Frank TV."" Mydamnchannel.com is running channels created by personalities with Hollywood street cred, like Harry Shearer, who voices several characters on ""The Simpsons."" Mydamnchannel CEO and former MTV executive Rob Barnett says he supports the writers' demands and hopes the strike will bring in more viewers. ""When there is nothing but repeats [on television], people will go searching for alternatives,"" he says. Mr. Shearer says those who do will notice the difference, both creatively and commercially.

A joint venture of NBC and News Corp. (which owns Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal), the seven-month-old Hulu primarily streams familiar TV shows and movies, such as ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Men In Black,"" and offers tools that let viewers post these videos directly on their own blogs, Facebook pages and other sites."
2008^Microsoft Corp. placed a bold $44.6 billion bet that buying Yahoo Inc. can transform both companies' flagging efforts to catch Google Inc.

Because Move isn't laying cable or launching satellites, the company's executives argue they can charge consumers far less than traditional pay-television operators for a comparable suite of channels.
2010^"Peter Noble, 43 years old, a social worker in Washington D.C., watches several hours of online video a week, including Crackle Inc.'s action miniseries ""Urban Wolf,"" which he found through Google Inc.'s YouTube, and anime shows (Japanese slang for animated series) on Hulu.

2011^"Sam Schechner Technology and media companies are racing to create Internet-video hits closer to the scale of traditional TV, as consumers start to watch more video on Internet-connected televisions and tablet computers.

2011^For the bloggers who use these sites, the exchange of copyrighted material and intellectual property--other people's photographs, music, lists of all the amazing things you ate for lunch--isn't just an aspect of the form, it's practically the entire business model. No, the Internet police probably aren't going to be kicking down your door to ask questions about that copyrighted photo of Ke$ha you just posted, but when it's almost as easy to do things the right way, why not at least try? It's a willful ignorance, says Bert Krages, a Portland, Ore., lawyer who specializes in intellectual property issues, and has written Legal Handbook for Photographers:

2011^"During the July filming for ""First Day,"" a comedy series for teenage girls, a woman with a spreadsheet and a red pen sat in a director's chair carefully checking off boxes.

The company was sharply criticized last July for removing live video from Minnesota woman Diamond Reynolds, who showed her boyfriend, Philando Castile, dying after being shot by a police officer during a traffic stop.

More than a decade ago, YouTube offered a way to share videos without passing through traditional media channels and their careful editorial principles and federal decency guidelines, and the short delay to catch inappropriate content. [...]the young people who seemed to be taking an interest in Facebook Live were in the same demographic group that was drifting away from Facebook in favor of apps such as disappearing-message service Snapchat.

2017^Facebook has been testing in-stream ads in videos over 90 seconds long for a number of months, but the addition of Watch content could create a host of new ad space for video advertisers to fill, provided the new shows succeed in attracting viewers and holding their attention.The addition of in-stream-only ad options might help attract ad dollars from marketers who have been reluctant to buy video ads in the news feed over concerns about the amount of time people actually view their ads.
