1998^"AOL now dominates cyberspace, and its recent agreement to buy Internet pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. has set the new-media world clucking about the ""C's"" for the coming year. The consensus, based on conversations across the Internet community, is that Mr. Case's three will give way to nine ""C's"" and a ""P"" in 1999: But even if it mauls the mall, electronic commerce faces some ugly facts of the retail world that not even the efficiencies of the Internet can ignore: the difficulty of maintaining margins in vicious price wars, the constant need to feed the marketing machine and the inevitability of competition. Most Internet executives seem positively frantic on this topic: Now that they have gotten your attention, how can they hold on to you? Many say the goal for 1999 will be to increase the number of ""hooks"" online companies can sink into a user. Among them: free e-mail, ""electronic wallets,"" Internet calendars and Web-based date books. That's because, says Julie Wainwright, chief executive officer of Reel.com Inc., an online video seller, many Internet users are still ""samplers."""
1999^Now, in the budding days of online video and tunes, music executives are getting tougher than ever in licensing negotiations. They are trying to prevent MTV from using its TV clout to crush a groundswell of rivals on the Web. Digital technology has spawned numerous music sites, from homegrown fan pages to sophisticated sites backed by the record companies themselves. They let fans listen to music, watch performances and buy tunes via the Web. And record industry executives want to make sure the sites thrive in the new wired world -- before MTV can dominate it. As for the Web, MTV hasn't asked for exclusivity, an MTV spokeswoman says. In some TV licensing renewal talks, however, the company has requested that competing Web sites not get videos any sooner than MTV's cable channel does, a person familiar with the discussions says. The record companies are eagerly signing licensing deals with MTV's Web rivals, executives say, but want richer licensing fees from the Web than those negotiated by MTV for television. The Justice Department began scrutinizing the music-video powerhouse, a unit of Viacom Inc., several months ago. The agency started looking into MTV's competitive practices in television when MTV acquired rival TV channel The Box in a deal with Liberty Digital, a unit of Liberty Media Corp. In addition to bringing a rival into the MTV fold, the deal also beefed up MTV's Web presence by linking its music sites with Liberty Digital's music sites, such as sonicnet.com and streamland.com.
2000^"Currently only a handful of companies offer broadband service. But Jupiter Communications, a New York market-research firm, estimates 2.8 million North American households will have cable modems by year end, with an additional one million or so DSL households. And there is still considerable room for growth: More than 48 million North American homes have cable-modem service available to them, while about half as many homes are within reach of DSL service from Bell Atlantic, SBC Communications and BellSouth Corp. By 2003, Jupiter estimates, 7.7 million households will use cable modems, compared with 5.7 million households for DSL.  Bell Atlantic -- which will become Verizon after its merger with GTE Corp. -- introduced its DSL service in October 1998, beginning in the Pittsburgh and Washington metro areas. By early May, the company had equipped more than 900 of its 2,500 central offices for DSL, and more than 19 million of the 44 million lines in its service area were ready for the service. Bell Atlantic began offering DSL service in New York last July, though the roll-out really gathered speed late last winter. Today, only a handful of the central offices serving the metro area aren't DSL-ready. At the end of May, Bell Atlantic had about 70,000 consumer DSL customers.  Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic and the Baby Bells are working on technological solutions to extend the range of DSL. At the same time, they're looking beyond DSL entirely. Mr. [Jeff Waldhuter] calls DSL ""an interim technology"" that he expects will be around for 15 years -- during which time Bell Atlantic will bring super-fast fiber-optic lines directly to more customers."
2000^Strategic Advantages: Disney acquired Infoseek and created the Go Network Internet portal to try to turn itself into an online competitor of AOL, Yahoo and other Web titans. The Go Network includes key Disney properties like ESPN.com, Disney.com and ABCNEWS.com. Go.com's advantage is the strength of its individual sites. ESPN.com, for example, is the longtime leader in online sports news.
2000^  Broadband Internet access is the future for PCs, TVs and other information appliances. Several online companies are retooling their offerings to include rich audio, video and interactive media that will take full advantage of fatter Net pipes. But the plain old telephone is making a surprising comeback. A growing number of companies are rolling out Net-access services that work over wired and wireless phones.
2001^  The future is likely to see homes with one full PC and an assortment of other specialized devices such as Web browsers or music players. The main reason this has not happened is that the devices, or information appliances, have so far not been very good. And they remain isolated gadgets, incapable of working together. Also, speech and vision capabilities will likely be incorporated, but currently are not well-developed.
2001^  The people who run struggling online media, e-commerce, and networking companies think they have identified the elixir to revive the Internet: broadband. They are all betting that high-speed Internet service will spur multimedia ads, snazzy video, and the ability to make impulse purchases. Unfortunately, it is a bad bet.
2002^  With PC sales expected to decline for the second straight year as corporate spending withers, Microsoft is aiming its big guns on entertainment goodies for the home.
2003^  After dominating the market for Internet access for nearly a decade, AOL has seen its 25 million US members begin to defect in droves to cut-rate dial-up competitors and to broadband rivals who are beginning to slash their monthly fees in a burgeoning price war. Now, AOL is launching a new effort to stem the tide. On July 31, the company will release the most significant upgrade to its software in years, certainly since the disastrous merger with Time Warner was unveiled in January, 2000. AOL 9.0 will boast over 100 new features, including faster downloads, free e-mail storage on AOL's computers, and an easy way for subscribers to keep blogs, or online journals. Most important, AOL 9.0 will be the doorway to a brand-new world of online content. It is designed to help subscribers tap into a growing number of music, video, and magazine offerings from Time Warner.
2003^  After years of anticipation, this holiday season seems destined to go down in the books as the First Broadband Christmas. Thanks to sharp cuts in the price of high-speed Internet access, the number of U.S. homes with broadband has jumped 38% from last holiday season to 22 million, according to consulting firm IDC. That spells big opportunities for e-merchants. Not only are broadband customers online for more of the day than their dial-up brethren, they also spend as much as 30% more. To reel in these shoppers, e-tailers ranging from Amazon.com Inc. to shoe site Zappos.com Inc. are ugrading their Web sites with videos, better pictures, more sophisticated product comparisons, and the ability to customize everything from diamond rings to dress shirts.
2003^  Tired of those trips to the video store to rent the latest DVD? Hollywood says it has the answer in a pair of online movie stores that let you download the latest Arnold or Julia flick directly to your computer. But, like everything Hollywood offers up, the magic is getting it on the screen. Unless you've got an up-to-date PC and a broadband connection, neither site is a real blockbuster. For starters, neither Movielink nor CinemaNow stocks nearly as many titles as your local video store. For those who just want to see Matrix Reloaded, the local video palace still beats these sites.
2004^Bernardus J. Verwaayen, the chief executive of London-based BT Group PLC, has in the past two years increased revenues, boosted margins, and restored positive cash flow. Verwaayen has now launched another bold plan. He intends to transfer the bulk of the companys core phone network by 2008 to a 21st century network using Internet technology. BT and Yahoo! have launched a leading-edge broadband package that lets customers send e-mail and instant messages, make phone and video calls over the Net, and manage contacts online. A new product, code-named Project Bluetooth, that could revolutionize telephony by erasing the gap between fixed and mobile service is also in the pipeline.
2004^"""The only reason it didn't succeed was broadband,"" says Mark Davis, managing partner of the venture-backed company practice at consultancy Deloitte &amp; Touche, which advised Mibrary. ""It came to the point of saying, 'This idea is just too early.' It would be perfect right now."" The Web casts, provided by Sportsline.com Inc. for a $9.95 subscription and free for AOL's three million high-speed subscribers, may not have been possible as recently as a year ago, says FeedRoom President and Chief Executive Jon Klein. ""We would have had far fewer viewers,"" says Mr. Klein, who in 1998 left his job as a senior executive overseeing CBS's 60 Minutes to start FeedRoom. ""There's now a critical mass of viewers for marketers to reach."" Another dot-com era media start-up company benefiting from the surge in broadband is the NewsMarket, a video-archive and distribution platform that allows the news media to access free broadcast-standard video over the Internet. ""The digital newsroom, [powered by] broadband, is transforming how the broadcast media operates,"" says Anthony Hayward, co-founder and chairman of the NewsMarket. ""Those same technologies are transforming how . . . companies are communicating. We sit right in the middle of that opportunity."""
2004^Third-generation mobile-phone service is taking off in Europe. The 3G that had provoked a $120 billion spectrum-licensing frenzy during the dot-com boom and then nearly destroyed Europe's telecommunications industry with multibillion-dollar losses has now finally arrived with its promise of cheaper voice calls, fast wireless Internet access, and exciting multi-media services such as streaming video clips and online gaming. Giants like Vodafone, T-Mobile, and Orange are rolling out business and consumer 3G service all over Europe.
2004^  Advertisers are seeing that the top few Web properties now reach true mass audiences. Each of the 3 biggest portals - AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! - attracts 70% of the Americans online to its properties monthly, according to comScore Networks, a traffic-tracking organization. Demand for this prime real estate is so strong that there isn't enough to go around, and prices to advertise are soaring. Facing a traffic jam at the top sites, advertisers are jostling for spots throughout the Net. The Internet is growing up. Broadband connections now reach more than half of American households, including the lion's share of the prosperous ones. Now that advertisers have their hands on a tool that measures an ad's effectiveness, they're starting to press other media for similar accountability. It's a process sure to cause disruptions. The portals are taking advantage of the hot video market to funnel advertisers toward thousands of their less-trafficked pages.
2004^  It looked like a boffo debut for William H. Gates III and his attempt to go Hollywood. Since the debacle, Microsoft has phased out the geeks in favor of Hollywood insiders. The company's goal is to persuade the studios to wrap their movies in Microsoft's software, which the company is offering for free. That way, Microsoft can turn around and sell the software that plays these digital versions of movies to computer makers, consumer-electronics companies, and online video services. The new approach is helping Microsoft make headway. Still, the studios remain wary of Microsoft, given its bruising monopolistic practices of the past.
2004^  Now that Apple has reinvented itself as the king of the digital music world, Microsoft is trying to wrestle that mantle away with a new breed of iPod rivals, including ones that play color video as well as music. On Sept. 2, the company is launching its most comprehensive foray yet into the digital media world. Portable video players, which run on Microsoft software and are made by Samsung Group and others, are just a piece of the tech giant's plan to steal Apple's rock 'n' roll mojo. Microsoft also is opening the doors to an online music store that includes a handful of popular artists that Apple's iTunes site doesn't have. More important, the company is rolling out an update of its Windows Media Player audio and video software that's designed to make it just as easy to purchase and manage music with Microsoft powered gear as it is with Apple's iPod and iTunes combo.
2004^  The US has steadily fallen behind other nations, both in terms of the share of the population with broadband and the speed of those connections. Broadband is the foundation upon which entire new generations of technology will be built: full-motion video, Web-based medical care, more sophisticated Internet telephoning, and online gaming. That's why the US is in dire need of stronger leadership in broadband. Both President George W. Bush and Democratic Presidential candidate John F. Kerry have pledged to tackle the issue after the election. But so far, their proposals are modest. Most markets are cozy duopolies, at best, where consumers can get broadband only from a phone or cable company. To have any hope of joining the world's broadband vanguard, the US must create a viable third competitor. Congress is unlikely to force politically powerful Bells to share their networks. Much more promising is the rivalry that might be sparked by new, inexpensive wireless technologies.
2005^"All of this is free to anyone with a taste for videos and an idea of where to find them. While many of the major search engines such as Google and Yahoo have video search sections, the results are often cluttered with extraneous material, just as they can be for text searches. It usually makes more sense to look for videos on a Web site that focuses on your topic: Go to a news network's site for the latest videos from the war in Iraq, a music site for the latest video from your favorite artist, a sports site for clips from last night's games, etc. To help you explore the expanding world of online videos, here's a sampling of some good places to start looking: Reuters also serves up a wide selection of video on topics such as world news, business and entertainment at TV.Reuters.com. Its popular ""Oddly Enough"" section offers funny and strange videos, such as a mouse riding a surfboard in Australia, or a man who repairs computers using his feet. Selecting any of the topic ""channels"" on the site's main page -- including ""Top News"" for the latest developments -- allows visitors to scroll through a listing of every video in that section. Video blogging isn't only for the personal or experimental. Some newspapers, such as the Spokesman Review, based in Spokane, Wash., are getting their feet wet with vlogs. As reporter Colin Mulvany explains on the site (SpokesmanReview.com/blogs/video), ""I want to tell stories the local TV news stations, with their breathless reporters, doing live standups of stale stories, fail to do anymore."" His almost daily vlogs touch on ""great little stories that go unnoticed each day,"" such as a profile of a Native American Vietnam veteran, a fire that ruined a local resident's home, and the prerelease party for the newest Harry Potter book."
2005^"""If you launch a channel of any kind and the content is popular, people will sponsor it,"" says a spokesman for for TiVo Inc., which has explored new forms of advertising. ""With vlogs the jury is still out."" For Mr. [Steve Garfield], vlogging is an easy outlet for his creative side. It's unlikely a major network would pick up ""The Carol and Steve Show,"" but the Internet allows him to broadcast his show as much as he wants along with other videos that teach would-be vloggers basic video techniques, as well a show he narrates called ""Vlog Soup"" pointing out his top picks among new vlogs. ""It's part of the democratization of media,"" says Mr. Garfield. ""It gives people the tools to express themselves and be creative in all different ways."""
2005^"Mr. [Jordan Golson]'s site -- at jlgolson.blogspot.com -- is just one of dozens of locations on the Internet hosting amateur videos of the Indian Ocean disaster. Many have been deluged with visitors eager to see more of the gripping footage than TV offers, or to watch videos over and over again on their own time. Some of these ""video blogs,"" like Mr. Golson's, are pre-existing text blogs, which typically include commentary and views on current events. Others have just sprung up in the last week. WaveofDestruction.org, created by an Australian blogger to host tsunami videos, logged 682,366 unique visitors from last Wednesday through Sunday morning, and has more than 25 amateur videos of the impact so far. Last year, video bloggers already showed their muscle by rapidly distributing a clip of singer Ashlee Simpson caught lip synching on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and another of the Daily Show's Jon Stewart clashing with the hosts of CNN's ""Crossfire."" According to Andreas Wacker, founder of blogsnow.com, a site that ranks blogs, the Crossfire video was downloaded by more people on the Internet than saw it on TV. ""When the Internet wants to see something, it sees it,"" he says. Bloggers don't charge for access, but they haven't been paying for copyrighted footage, either. And bloggers seldom ask each other for permission. ""The law really hasn't caught up,"" says Mr. Golson. ""The rule of thumb is you can take stuff as long as you say where you got it from,"" and as long as you don't sell it, he adds."
2005^  As much as one terabyte of data is added to the Net each day, researchers say. That's the equivalent of 50,000 short videos, 250 million magazine stories, or 500 million blog entries. Is there any way to sort through it all to find what you truly want? One answer may be found at a little-known San Francisco startup called digg. Founded by Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, the company's Web site pulls together articles, links, and other info, largely about the tech industry. What's unusual is the method by which content is organized. The company relies on its 80,000 members to unearth the most interesting goodies on the Net each day. It's an early example of the collective strength of online crowds -- and hints at how the sea of online video, podcasts, and blog entries could be organized in the future.
2005^  In the marketing departments of some of the world's biggest advertisers, online video represents a golden opportunity to move beyond the 30-second spots that TV viewers so often zap or ignore. These advertisers view online video as a laboratory for new ways to connect with customers. And they're busy figuring out ways to use the Internet to transform the most powerful advertising tool in history: television. The internet has been promising this video invasion for a decade. But the growth of broadband connections is finally bringing video into the mainstream. For now, the trend is to use video ads online as extensions of TV campaigns. In this new ad world, it's often better to whisper the brand than to shout it. The key is to create buzz and to spread from friend to friend across the Net.
2005^  Is there redemption in cyberspace? That's the question for Brad Greenspan, a 32-year-old entrepreneur who started his first business from his dorm room at the University of California at Los Angeles and helped launch one of the Internet's biggest hits, the wildly popular social networking site MySpace.com, when he invested in it in 2003. Today he's backing what he bets will be the Next Big Thing: a social network site called Vidilife that is using online videos to lure Net surfers, a sort of MySpace for the video crowd. Traffic has been promising so far: 220,000 unique users in October, six weeks after launch in September, according to Internet ratings agency comScore Media Metrix. Vidilife is more than just a business move for Greenspan; he needs it to help restore his street cred as a Net mogul. That's because he never got to celebrate MySpace's huge success. He was forced from the company he founded.
2005^  Suddenly, broadband is opening the floodgates for a new kind of TV show -- only not on TV but online. In just the past few months some of the biggest TV names have announced new broadband channels, from MTV Networks to Comedy Central to ABC News. If you thought the 400 cable channels focusing on everything from golf to anime were already cutting niches thin, broadband TV is going a step further. It has the makings of another Internet gold rush. With improved speeds and video quality online, not to mention broadband's growing reach (estimated conservatively to be in 40 million U.S. homes by yearend), TV executives are rushing to connect with younger audiences that are less and less riveted to traditional TV. Getting a foothold on the Internet, especially if it creates buzz, is also a way to recapture ad dollars that have migrated away from the 30-second TV spot. On the Web, ads can be positioned strategically next to programming and measured with greater accuracy.
2005^  The latest Net phenomenon is video blogs, or what some folks call vlogs. Thousands of ordinary people have begun posting a cornucopia of video fare online, from self-indulgent art clips and earnest citizen journalism to sly political commentary. Experimentation is the rule, and eccentrics outnumber serious practitioners. But amid the chaos, glimpses of a commercial future are starting to emerge, including a revival of online video distribution, using vlogs to sell ads, and corporate sites designed to reach out to customers and suppliers. Online video had a brief heyday during the late 1990s, with indie-flick sites with the aim of developing online movie distribution. Those dreams mostly ended with the popping of the Net bubble. But thanks to the blog craze and the proliferation of high-speed broadband, new pioneers are emerging. The development is due in large part to the spread of better distribution technology.
2005^  The mad land grabs in media and entertainment orchestrated by larger-than-life founders have run their course. In this twilight of the moguls, a new, younger generation of executives is waiting in the wings to inherit an industry in upheaval. Today's executives have to manage in three dimensions -- constantly imagining their books, magazines, movies, shows, and games in an array of digital forms. Back in the fall of 2000, when Major League Baseball came calling, Robert A. Bowman was faced with adapting the 120-year-old game for today's fans. As CEO of Major League Baseball Advanced Media LP, the Wharton MBA decided early on to deliver online and digital services directly to fans, without an intermediary such as Yahoo. MLB.com, with revenues of about $125 million last year, sells 30 services, from live video and audio of full games to fantasy baseball video-games, all available on the Net and on cell phones. No media company is immune to the lesson learned by the loss of 30% of music sales in recent years through illegal file-sharing and CD burning. So Michele Anthony, 48, executive vice-president at Sony BMG Music Entertainment, stumps on college campuses, hoping to steer students away from stealing music. As executive vice-president for business development and digital media at NBC Universal, R. Brandon Burgess is the front-line guy for new revenue streams. Burgess helped in the rollout last year of NBC Mobile, which offers cell-phone users two-minute-long video news broadcasts.
2005^  These are the early days of video blogging. Most of the postings on the Web are rough and tedious - little more than home movies. But the success of Rocketboom and a few sites like it underscore the potential of video blogs. Cheaper video recorders mean just about anyone can make videos, while the spread of speedy Net service means almost anybody can watch clips posted online. The result? The Internet is coming alive with a mix of video, from the polished parody of Rocketboom to the raw interviews of reporters. As these videos flow into the living room, they will reshape what we think of as television. Amanda Congdon and Andrew Michael Baron have no doubt their quirky show is the future. So while Rocketboom shows are lighthearted, the two are dead serious about their work.
2005^  While broadcast TV audiences dwindle and moviegoing stagnates, gaming is emerging as the newest and perhaps strongest pillar of the media world. So it's no surprise film studios, media giants, game makers, and Japanese electronics companies are all battling to win the Game Wars. When Electronic Arts Inc spent $800 million to lock up ESPN content such as X-Game sports competition for use in games for the next 15 years, it was just the latest jolt to an industry in which megadeals have become as commonplace as laser-toting ogres. Next came the news that Microsoft Corp plans to produce the movie version of its Halo megahit video games, which have raked in $600 million since 2001, rather than handing the job to a studio. Gaming is exploding in all directions - going online, mobile, and global. On Web sites such as Microsoft's Xbox Live, 1.4 million hard-core gamers match up their reflexes in multiplayer shoot-'em-up games for bragging rights in cyberspace. Even the tiny screen is grabbing attention, as cell-phone titles take gaming anytime, anywhere. By 2008, the markets for online and mobile-phone gaming are expected to top $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively.
2006^"At issue is the widespread presence of copyright music and video content on MySpace. In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for California's Central District, Vivendi SA's Universal dismisses the frequently used label ""user-generated content"" -- alleging that much of the material on MySpace is stolen from copyright holders. Universal executives have been outraged by the leak. In a recent interview, Antonio Reid, chairman of Universal's Island Def Jam Music Group, said next week's debut of the Jay-Z album would likely be ""devastated"" by the leaks. ""I'm sure it's cut into our sales, and not by a small amount,"" Mr. Reid said. ""Even if it [sells] a million units it's not what it should have been."""
2006^"Comedy Central, part of MTV Networks, has bought the TV and digital rights to the animated series, ""Lil' Bush: Resident of the United States,"" and will co-produce it with Amp'd Mobile and the show's creator Donick Cary, a TV writer who has written for ""Late Show with David Letterman"" and ""The Simpsons."" Comedy Central plans to air the half-hour show weekly beginning next summer during the popular 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. time slot, possibly right after ""South Park"" and before ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."" ""Lil' Bush"" will no doubt raise the profile of Amp'd. Comedy Central, however, says its decision to air ""Lil' Bush"" wasn't influenced by MTV Networks' ownership in Amp'd or Messrs. Messrs. [Phillippe Dauman]'s and [Thomas Dooley]'s past investment in the carrier. ""Washington is like a school yard,"" full of petty and juvenile behavior, says Mr. Cary, whose studio in Bulgaria does the animation work. Mr. Cary presented clips of ""Lil' Bush"" to Comedy Central while producing another show for the channel called ""The Naked Trucker and T-Bones"" that's scheduled to air in January."
2006^"David Letterman's raw, heartfelt post-9/11 monologue? Removed at the request of CBS. Whatever Mr. [Bill Simmons] billed as ""the second greatest YouTube clip of all-time unless you're a Yankee fan""? Gone -- Major League Baseball's new-media arm objected. The trailer for ""Karate Kid III""? Removed for violating YouTube's terms of use. A clip from the ancient proto-reality-TV show ""Battle of the Network Stars""? Ditto. A clip of great baseball fights from ESPN, Mr. Simmons' employer? Going, going, gone. YouTube is ingenious. It's a pleasure. In some cases it's clearly been a boon for content creators. (Take the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit ""Lazy Sunday,"" an early YouTube favorite now available from NBC, or OK Go's video for ""Here It Goes Again,"" still available on YouTube.) There is genuinely popular material on it that isn't violating copyright, a claim that was hard to believe when made by Napster and its ilk. (Take this quietly haunting clip, seen more than 3.5 million times.) It can be argued that it serves a social good. (The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating two officers for allegedly beating a suspect last summer -- in large part because of a video that's been seen hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube.) Certainly it's become a media force in its own right. (The Republicans might still control the Senate if not for Virginia Sen. George Allen's ""macaca"" remark, widely disseminated on YouTube.) Music videos don't belong on YouTube -- they're entire works of art in their own right, and a market for them exists. (Witness iTunes.) But beyond that, where's the harm? It's risible to suggest that content owners are hurt by videos of teenagers lip-synching to hip-hop songs, that the market for sports DVD is destroyed by fans being allowed to relive a team's great moment, or that artists reusing footage of some famous televised event destroys interest in documentaries. Mr. Letterman's post-9/11 monologue resonates for Mr. Simmons and others five years later -- shouldn't it be available online? I couldn't find it; a CBS spokeswoman said she doesn't think it's available. It should be: It's part of our common culture, along with those big sports moments, bits of televised history and famous TV moments. Isn't there some social value to making these bits of video simply and easily available for anyone and everyone to view, reinterpret and comment on?"
2006^"For advertisers, Web television delivers a dream audience of dedicated fans. ""The fact they've gone and sought it out [online] indicates they're pretty loyal, passionate viewers of a show,"" says Mark Simmons, national manager of advertising strategy and media for Toyota, which advertises on many of Disney's online shows. ""It's a step beyond appointment viewing."" Toyota says it's too early to tell how the online shows will affect the company's relationship with Disney, or its regular TV advertising. The car maker also won't disclose what it's paying for the online ads. Disney hasn't set regular rates for the shows, but they are likely to be considerably less than the $550,000 to $650,000 the network charges for a 30-second ad on the broadcast version of ""Lost"" or ""Desperate Housewives."" Fans make the same argument. For instance, an avid viewer of the mystery series ""Veronica Mars"" has created an interactive map showing locations from the program. Why? ""It's another way of generating publicity for 'Veronica Mars,' and we're constantly on the bubble in terms of ratings,"" says the map's creator, a 40-year-old college professor who prefers that her name not be used."
2006^"IT MIGHT NOT qualify as an art form, but it's a format that's on the rise on the Internet: the fake movie trailer that twists an existing movie into a completely different genre. Through incongruous music and editing tricks, ""Psycho"" appears to be a romantic comedy and ""West Side Story"" looks like a slasher flick. The clips have become calling cards of sorts for artists and editors hoping to get noticed. Patrick De Nicola, a 21-year-old junior at Boston's Emerson College, says he's been fielding emails from television networks and comedy clubs since putting one online two weeks ago."
2006^"""It's such a mess because the [entertainment companies] have all of these valuable assets that are just locked up with so many people who need to sign off on them,"" says YouTube Chief Executive Chad Hurley. ""I don't know what it requires, if the government needs to be involved,"" Mr. Hurley laughs. ""I don't know."" Clips from TV shows present similar copyright challenges. A show such as the hit medical drama ""ER,"" for example, has dozens of rights holders. Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. owns the majority of the show, with co-creators Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton having minority stakes. The studio licenses ""ER"" to General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal, Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System for cable repeats and to local stations for weekend airings. Then there are the actors in every episode and details such as the music, which in most cases is purchased with broadcast rights only. Sorting out this rat's nest can take years. It took NBC Universal more than two years, for example, to clear the rights necessary to make the first two seasons of ""Miami Vice"" available on DVD. YouTube's challenges parallel those stirred up by virtually every new entertainment medium to come along in recent years, including DVDs, digital tracks sold by Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes online music store, satellite radio, cellphone ring tones and online music subscription services. ""It's almost like technology has pushed far beyond the business practices and the law, and now everything needs to kind of catch up,"" says Chris Maxcy, YouTube's business development vice president."
2006^"It's the next iteration of the burgeoning self-help industry: teaching people the obvious. After the success of do-it-yourself books and TV shows that offer expert advice on everything from baking your own wedding cake to remodeling a four-story home, a number of new Web sites are hoping to make money sticking with the basics. On eHow.com, one of the most popular topics is ""How to Boil an Egg"" -- broken down into six steps of written instructions. Videos at ViewDo.com, launched this summer, address such matters as how to peel and slice an apple. WikiHow.com provides a written tutorial on playing ""Hide and Go Seek."" (Step Three: ""Determine who will be 'It.'. . . Use 'One Potato, Two Potato' or similar method."") In many cases, the obvious is proving popular. On VideoJug, a lesson in ""How to Brush Your Teeth"" ranks well above ""How to Make Chicken Jalfrezi"" on the site's ""Most Viewed"" list. The site's video on ""How to Fold a T-Shirt in Two Seconds"" has been viewed nearly 40,000 times. The current version is a seven-step, 850-word guide, with five ""warnings,"" including one about peanut allergies, and 13 additional ""tips,"" such as ""spread peanut butter on both bread slices"" to prevent a ""jelly breach."""
2006^"Moreover, [Google]'s huge investment in a site exclusively devoted to video (the YouTube acquisition is the largest in the company's history), is seen as a sign that Google has ambitions to dominate the field of video search much in the way it has done text. That's likely to set off a race among Google's competitors to stake out the market -- often deploying cutting-edge technology that they hope will give them an edge. ""Google's acquisition of YouTube marks a turning point,"" says Tim Tuttle, vice president of AOL Video, who says AOL is now trying to carve out its own niche in the space by searching across as many different sources of video as possible -- not just those it hosts. U.S. Internet users streamed more than seven billion videos in July, according to comScore Networks Inc. MySpace.com captured the largest share, followed by Yahoo and YouTube. But when measured by overall traffic, YouTube holds the top spot, with 46% of visits among the top sites tracked by market researcher Hitwise. ""There is no Google or Yahoo of video search,"" says Brian Haven, an analyst at market researcher Forrester Research. ""But with the content exploding and the momentum so strong, there is no way around it happening."" Other technologies that are still being tested include facial-recognition software and the ability to tag different frames in a clip to help search within videos. People who upload videos have their own complaints. Kevin Nalty, a health-care marketer from Doylestown, Pa., says figuring out which of his videos will show up where is a guessing game because the sites are ""bloated"" with inventory. As a result, the 39-year-old tries to label his videos with as many peripherally related words he can think of, including misspellings. By labeling one recent video documenting his attempt to tape wheels onto his daughter's sneakers with the word ""Healies"" -- a misspelling of ""Heelys,"" the popular sneakers with retractable wheels -- he was able to climb higher in various video- search results."
2006^"Much as with pitching traditional journalists, the key with blogging is to have something to say beyond just ""buy my product."" Mark Hughes, author of ""Buzzmarketing,"" calls this ""story wrapping."" Says Mr. Hughes: ""No one is going to talk about the guy who cleans gutters because there is no inherent story value. But they might talk about the guy who cleans gutters who wears a tuxedo."" It paid off. In recent months, Gopher State Taxi has routinely popped first on Google's sponsored link for core keywords, including: ""Minneapolis, airport, taxi."" Mr. [Kenny Kormendy] says his business has grown to a network of nearly three dozen cabs and he is off welfare. He estimates his total payout to Google is about $175 to $205 monthly, based on how many clicks his ads get. ""People with cellphones on planes can find me,"" he says. ""Almost every time I ask someone, they tell me it was on the Internet. And nine times out of 10 it's from Google. I don't have $50,000 to compete with [bigger taxi companies]. But with what I create off the Internet, I can blow them away."" Beyond that, it's critical to make your Web site search-friendly, or search-optimal, for certain keywords. In the early days, search optimization was largely a matter of inserting enough important keywords into your Web site that it would become visible to search engines. In some cases, this still works. Mr. Hughes, the author of ""Buzzmarketing,"" also does speaking for a living. He wanted to pit himself as a viable alternative for people looking to book Malcolm Gladwell, the best-selling author of ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink."" So Mr. Hughes created a Web page within his own site, buzzmarketing.com, that compares ""Speaker Malcolm Gladwell vs. Business Speaker Mark Hughes."" By using the words ""Malcolm Gladwell speaker"" roughly every 300 words on that page, a link to his comparison is now usually among those that pop up on the first search page of Google when you type the words: ""Malcolm Gladwell speaker."" Soon after that page went up, Mr. Hughes says, he got a $17,000 speaking gig from a company that located him that way. (Says Mr. Gladwell of Mr. Hughes's efforts: ""How could I not be flattered?"")"
2006^"New York -- EVERYBODY'S TALKING about YouTube -- and not always nicely, either. Doug Morris, who runs Universal Music, gave a speech the other day in which he proclaimed that the 19-month-old online video-sharing Web site owes his conglomerate ""tens of millions of dollars"" for allowing copyrighted music videos to be posted without permission. Mr. Morris's shot across the bow was quickly followed by the announcement that Warner Music, Universal's smarter competitor, has struck a deal allowing YouTube, which receives 100 million hits a day, to show its videos in return for a chunk of ad revenue. Says Warner Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr.: ""Consumer-empowering destinations like YouTube have created a two-way dialogue that will transform entertainment and media."" In recent months, jazz-loving friends have been sending me YouTube links to videos by Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and other celebrated artists, most of them drawn from films of the '30s and '40s and TV shows of the '50s and '60s. Some of this material is available on DVD, but most of it lingered in limbo until Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, YouTube's co-founders, made it possible for anyone with a computer to post and view video clips at will. Fascinated by the links unearthed by my friends, I spent the better part of a long weekend trolling through YouTube in search of similar material. When I was done, I'd found hundreds of videos, some extremely rare and all compulsively watchable, posted by collectors from all over the world."
2006^"Teenagers have begun posting audition tapes on YouTube and MySpace for a series called ""The New 22,"" which its creator, production company Evolution Entertainment describes as a younger version of ""The View."" The casting call was placed through koldCast.com, a new site launched by Irvine, Calif., product-placement company EMmerzion Worldwide to let actors post online auditions. In exchange, the company gets dibs on selling product placements in movies and TV shows that use actors found through the service. Jessie Bronfman, a 25-year-old Woodmere, N.Y., resident who wants to be a TV host, has applied online for a video-jockey position and is hoping to score a role in ""The New 22."" She spends at least an hour a day searching for new online auditions through Craigslist, YouTube and Google, then cultivates her online network of friends who vote for her in video contests and help her get higher ""hit counts"" for audition videos."
2006^The agreement, to take effect before the end of the year, illustrates YouTube's push to tackle the thorny copyright issues facing it and other sites that allow users to upload video content. YouTube is developing an automated system to digitally identify copyrighted music and video uploaded by its users. It will then give a percentage of revenue from any ads that appear alongside those videos on YouTube's Web site, if their owners have agreements with YouTube and opt for that rather than having the videos removed.
2006^The explosive growth of Internet video is allowing people not only to find an audience for their amateur productions. Now they can actually earn money from them. San Diego-based Eefoof Inc., launched just over a week ago, shares 50% of its profits from text ads and banner ads with users who upload their own online video clips. Shares are distributed based on the number of hits a particular video receives. Recently launched Panjea.com, operated by Aware Media Inc., shares 50% of revenue from the ads appearing on profile pages to which users can upload their own video and audio files. Users can also sell their content via download at a price they set, in which case they earn 85% of the sale. In May, Blip Networks Inc.'s Blip.TV began giving members half of the ad revenue it earns from the still- photograph and video ads that users can have placed at the end of their videos. Revver affixes an ad frame to the end of a video clip and gives the users 50% of the revenue generated when the ad is clicked on, whether the video is accessed from a Web site, shared across instant-messaging services or emailed between friends. Watching online video, from comedy skits to failed cooking experiments, is fast becoming a favorite Internet amusement. Nearly one-quarter of Internet users watch online video at least once a week, according to the Online Publishers Association. To date, video sites have typically relied on members' good will and boredom to stock up on inventory that is funny, fresh and contagious. Now new sites hope that dangling cash perks before video uploaders will help them win traffic from more established players like YouTube and Google Video while helping creators share in the success of these sites. Using an ad- sharing service doesn't prevent filmmakers from also posting their clips on YouTube. YouTube did not answer repeated requests for comment.
2006^"Then there is Bree, known as ""lonelygirl15"" on Youtube. She might be everything she appears to be -- a sweet, wide-eyed, intelligent-sounding teenager -- but YouTubers have their doubts. Her videos have been among the most watched and most discussed on YouTube for months now. Many of these exchanges -- posted in a comment section on the site -- center on a picture of famed 20th-century occultist and practitioner of ""black magic"" Aleister Crowley that can be seen hanging on the wall of her room. Is Bree a satanist? YouTubers have even been led to question whether Bree herself isn't someone's invention -- an actress with a script -- and whether her travails are luring viewers in to some darker plot point in the future. The cynicism and skepticism of our age, then, are still there. But watching YouTube is not like watching a polished movie because we don't know where we stand. The result is what one might call interactive entertainment on steroids. Viewers are not only trying to anticipate or even influence the next plot twist within a YouTube auteur's own terms. They are often busily trying to determine whether those terms should be accepted in the first place. One YouTuber has gone so far as to create a character he named ""BreesFather,"" who offers monologues in the guise of Bree's (supposedly) Satan-loving father. Thus he has made himself part of Bree's story, at least as experienced by YouTubers. He's not ""real,"" of course. But whether he's any less real than renetto or Bree herself is hard to tell."
2006^"The two see branching out beyond ""Ninja"" as key to long-term success. ""'Ask a Ninja' was always kind of a proof of concept for us,"" says Mr. Nichols. ""We've looked at others who have been successful but they didn't know how to work with new talent and bring fresh ideas into the fold. Dick Clark makes more money in his sleep producing things than he ever does on camera."" EMMY-NOMINATED PODCASTERS Orrin and Jerry Zucker, ""It s Jerry Time"" itsjerrytime.com The Zucker brothers (no relation to the writer-director brothers behind films such as ""Airplane!"") were among the only amateurs nominated for the first ""iPod Emmy,"" awarded this year to shows made for portable players (AOL won for its ""Live 8 concert broadcasts last summer). Their sitcom-like video podcast uses collage-style animation to recount Jerry's day-to-day exploits. VIDEO PODCAST STARS Kent Nichols and [Douglas Sarine] ""Ask a Ninja,"" askaninja.com Some episodes of this video podcast, which features weekly monologues from a sarcastic ninja character, have had close to 1 million views on YouTube. Made by Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sarine, it regularly tops the iTunes podcast charts, and has inspired dozens of amateurs to make their own ninja tribute videos. They ve recently launched another show, ""Hope is [Emo],"" which stars a young woman and has risen to the top 25 on iTunes in part because of its affiliation with ""Ask a Ninja."""
2006^"The U.N. has enlisted the star of hugely popular Web video series LonelyGirl15 and other Web video makers to participate in an ad campaign promoting an antipoverty event it plans Sunday. Jessica Lee Rose, the teenage actress who plays ""Bree"" in Lonelygirl15 videos posted on video-sharing Web site YouTube, will reprise the role that made her famous, sitting in a bedroom by herself, talking into a camera. But this time, rather than talking about a boy, ""Bree"" makes a plea for the antipoverty cause. The Lonelygirl's antipoverty video, like those made by other amateur video makers, has been posted on YouTube. The U.N. hopes the videos will spark buzz about its call for people around the world to ""stand up against poverty"" at rallies and other events planned for a 24-hour period Sunday. The online videos are part of a broader ad campaign, designed by WPP Group's ad agency Y&amp;R, also involving television. The ad is the first marketing pitch to make use of the LonelyGirl15 character but it may not be the last, Mr. [Greg Goodfried] said. After being approached by Y&amp;R about two weeks ago, the group agreed to participate in the ad because it was ""a really good cause"" and the issue of poverty ""is something that needs more attention,"" says Ms. Rose, the actress appearing in the ad. Mr. Goodfried says they are open to more marketing alliances but says they wouldn't want to let ""Bree"" become ""overcommercialized."""
2006^"""When trying to use any virtual technology in the political space, one still has to remember how people think in the real world. Something that doesn't work in the real world probably won't work just because technology is cool. In 2004, everyone was obsessed with Howard Dean's campaign's Internet strategy. It wasn't a new technology so much as a way to tap into Americans' desire to feel included in the political process. 'What Americans Know' is the definitive text on how to understand the American voter. I often go back and reread this key book for insights into the thought process of the voters."" That said, I don't think the risk is too great. YouTube is far different from Napster or Grokster. The core idea of YouTube is that a user creates a work on their own and then shares it online. The thrust of the business is not to encourage anyone to violate copyright, but rather to create works that they then can distribute online. The business model that YouTube features is a far cry from any of the early music file-sharing businesses. That difference in business model should make a big difference in terms of the copyright risk calculus. MR. [Stan Liebowitz]: Although the purpose of YouTube might be to encourage home-grown creative endeavors, some portion of YouTube files have been pure copyrighted files with no home-grown component, although it appears that YouTube has taken them down when requested."
2006^"YouTube's new system is the latest attempt by an online startup to transition from disputed copyright practices to a less-controversial business model. TV and movie companies are just starting to come to grips with how to manage video-sharing technology. There are signs they could be interested in cutting deals: Several TV executives say they have been in talks with YouTube and other video sites about ways to make some content freely available. General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal signed an advertising and content deal with YouTube in June. YouTube's agreement with Warner hinges on a digital system YouTube is developing to identify automatically copyrighted music or other audio, and related video its users upload. The system relies partly on what's known as ""fingerprinting"" -- comparing audio uploaded to the site to unique attributes of copyrighted content it already knows. YouTube's planned system is similar in some respects to one proposed last year by an online music startup, Snocap Inc., which was launched by Shawn Fanning, the founder of Napster. Snocap is seeking to help peer-to-peer music services and other online outlets become legitimate music distributors. YouTube said the audio-identification system could potentially be used to locate non-music content such as video clips from TV shows, and that it could eventually use video-identification technology as well. YouTube currently faces legal challenges. Robert Tur, the owner of Los Angeles News Service, named YouTube in a complaint filed in July in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. He alleges copyright infringement in connection with several videos that were available through YouTube. YouTube has said Mr. Tur's suit is ""without merit."" A similar case, which an adult-entertainment company, Io Group Inc., brought against a video-sharing site, Veoh Networks Inc., in June in U.S. District Court for California's Northern District, makes a similar claim. A ruling against Veoh could potentially set a precedent affecting YouTube."
2006^"  According to angry consumers and the New York State Attorney General, Direct Revenue makes ""spyware."" These programs track where you go on the Internet and clutter your screen with annoying pop-up advertisements for everything from pornography to wireless phone plans. Spyware can get stuck in your computer's hard drive as you shop, chat, or download a song. It might arrive attached to that clever video you just nabbed at no charge. Web security company McAfee Inc. estimates that nearly three-quarters of all sites listed in response to Internet searches for popular phrases like ""free screen savers"" or ""digital music"" attempt to install some form of advertising software in visitors' computers. Once lodged there, spyware can sap a PC's processing power, slow its functioning, and even cause it to crash. The Web is the hottest game in advertising, but what's rarely acknowledged is the extent to which unsavory pop-ups boost the returns. Some advertisers say their messages have appeared in pop-ups without their permission. Others seek out pop-ups, and Direct Revenue frequently sells ads directly to such advertisers."
2006^  All Chad Hurley and Steve Chen wanted to do was share some videos from a dinner party with a half-dozen friends in San Francisco. It was January, 2005, and they couldn't figure out a good solution. Sending the clips around by e-mail was a bust: The e-mails kept getting rejected because they were so big. Posting the videos online was a headache, too. So last February the two buddies got to work in Hurley's garage, determined to design something simpler. What they came up with is a Web site, now called YouTube, that has become an Internet phenomenon. In 11 months the site has become one of the most popular on the Net. It shows 30 million videos a day and drew 9.1 million people in February, says Web measurement service Nielsen//NetRatings. That makes the upstart one of the biggest providers of videos on the Net, ahead of Yahoo! and Google and just behind Microsoft, according to the Nielsen//NetRatings estimates. The trouble is, the freewheeling approach that has made YouTube a hit could be its downfall. Users have been posting videos that are still under copyright, without any of the required legal approvals.
2006^  A year ago, Yahoo!'s ambitions in the media industry were nothing short of audacious. Yahoo! Inc. execs spoke of creating smash-hit, medium-defining programming for the interactive world. The company furiously set to work on a number of high-profile content ideas, from adapting the abandoned reality-TV show The Runner into a multimillion-dollar Internet program to developing a home-electronics reality contest, dubbed Wow House. Today, after a turbulent year in the media business, Yahoo is singing a much more modest tune. Large projects such as The Runner are in a holding pattern as Yahoo susses out the potential business opportunities. Wow House has been sent back to the drawing board. Yahoo's original content endeavors, from celebrity blogs to the online reality shows, have fallen flat or been stuck in development. Certainly, Yahoo has plenty going for it. The company boasts over 400 million visitors and a media division that streams more music videos than anyone else each month. But its reluctance to aggressively pursue outside content unless it can add its own twist could hurt its efforts to pull in advertisers.
2006^  Everyone from Time Warner and Viacom to Yahoo! and Microsoft is under enormous pressure to acquire the next MySpace or YouTube. But amid steadily rising valuations, Old and New Media executives alike are afraid of overpaying and being punished by their shareholders. They are seeing a valuation gap that sometimes doesn't make sense, says Wade Davis, Viacom's senior vice-president for mergers and acquisitions, who has overseen a handful of Web 2.0 deals whose prices collectively are well below what Google is paying for YouTube. Time Warner Chairman and CEO Richard D. Parsons, still dealing with the aftermath of the disastrous merger with AOL in 2001, has similar concerns. Paying up is less of a concern for a Google, of course. While Old Media continues to suffer from lagging stock prices and tepid advertising revenues, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have huge cash hoards, manageable debt, and, in the case of Google, a lofty stock price. Paying $1.65 billion for YouTube amounts to less than 2% of Google's $130 billion market cap - and the big bet on the video-sharing site could be as much about gut and ego as it is about hard-nosed business sense. Nonetheless, some analysts see a lot of froth in the market, and the risk remains that even highfliers like MySpace and YouTube could flame out if their fickle, youthful audiences decide to move on.
2006^  Far from the land of dogs on skateboards and Webcam yakkers on YouTube, the online genre of scripted programs is attracting small but passionate groups of fans. The networks and talent agencies are watching closely, and the phenomenon is giving indie filmmakers new ways to get their works seen. Given these webcasts' ability to generate dedicated followers, their potential seems particularly attractive to advertisers. Advertisers are looking for a Google-like system that will tell them where and when to put their ads next to scripted Web shows. Another alternative would be a site that hosts many such niche shows, so it would have the economies of scale to serve up longer, higher-resolution videos and maintain an ad sales force.
2006^"  If movie studios hope to dodge the fate of the music industry, whose growth was cut short in part by illegal downloading, they need to come up with a solution to illegal copying. So studios are prodding the feds to put some fear into pirates. The goal: stem the $6.1 billion that the industry estimates was lost to illegal copying in 2005. Half of pirated material is in DVDs sold on street corners, but $3 billion comes from pirates stealing digital movies and posting them online. A global investigation is methodically targeting piracy rings from Chicago to Charlotte, NC, to China. To date, a California investigation has won 24 convictions. The picture that emerges from these investigations is of loosely knit cybergangs, driven more by competitive zeal than profit motive. A skilled ""cammer,"" who records movies in a theater and sends them off for uploading to the Net, can make up to $2,000 per film. But most pirates are in it for the thrill of proving their coding skills."
2006^  In the past year, cellular-service providers and phonemakers have begun moving to faster networks, including something new called WiMAX, which is like Wi-Fi writ large. This will unleash a flood of innovative mobile gadgets and services that will stretch the definition of wireless as we know it. This latest phase of the mobile revolution is intimately tied to the abrupt rise of media-rich social networks such as Google Inc.'s YouTube and News Corp.'s MySpace.com. Groups of friends crave connectedness, and they achieve it by swapping photos, music, and video clips, immersing themselves in a shared chronicle of daily life. To participate, you used to have to sit in front of a computer screen. Now the handset, stuffed with content you purchase or create, will become your personal television network, your music studio, and your wallet for dispensing digital money. South Korea and Japan have emerged as oracles of mobility. More than 3 million Koreans regularly use their mobile phones to log on to the giant Cyworld social networking site. Both Japan and Korea are starting to roll out speedy WiMAX data networks that can deliver wireless broadband access to entire cities.
2006^  Move over, MySpace. Just as the big online social networks are branching out, trying to reach an audience broader than teens and Gen Y, a raft of upstarts hopes to reach these same prospects. To attract older or less tech-savvy folks, they're offering ever-more-targeted services that can be personalized to people's existing social groups and interests. These new social-networking sites range from karaoke and photography communities on Multiply to canine sites on Dogster and community TV-style personal video sites and mothers' groups created using do-it-yourself services such as Ning and PeopleAggregator. The big question is whether these sites, which depend largely on advertising for revenues, can overcome the awesome momentum of such leaders as News Corp.'s MySpace, with 130 million users and 8 million more each month, and Facebook, with 12 million people.
2006^"  Nearly 40 years ago, in a blue-collar Irish neighborhood in Scranton, Pa., Judy McGrath fell in love with music. Her life took a magical detour that led her to write on-air promotions for a new invention, music television. Twenty-five years later, she is chairman and CEO of MTV Networks Co. The $7 billion-a-year operation she oversees is a collection of some of the most recognizable brands in the business, from the original MTV to Nickelodeon to VH1 to Comedy Central. Their programs are seen in 169 countries and heard in 28 languages. Today the girl with a bohemian streak and rock 'n' roll dreams has one of the biggest and most challenging jobs in media. The music channel may have seemed bold and experimental when it began in August, 1981. But the MTV empire today is a staple of the media Establishment and faces a slew of new threats. After all, it's the iPod era, a broadband world, and the online generation is defining for itself what is edgy and new. Ratings may be strong for many of the channels, but the original MTV isn't the must-see it was. So McGrath has declared ""a digital Marshall Plan."" It signals the end of the one-screen company. The troops must now deliver services across new broadband channels, over cell phones, and via video games. No piece of the network is under as much fire as the core MTV channels. And McGrath is doing something alien to the start-from-scratch culture: seeking acquisitions and partnerships."
2006^  Owners of TV stations once had to try to mess up the business.Oh, sure, there was competition from cable, endless wrangling with the networks you did business with, and costly local news wars, fought with expensive gimmicks like news choppers. But local TV was a relatively undisturbed patch of the sandbox. Then Apple unveiled the video iPod. And ABC started selling programs as $1.99 downloads before subsequently announcing that it would stream shows over the Web, sell ads around them, and not share those revenues with local station affiliates. But sometimes the Web can give back some of what it takes away, and there's untapped upside for local TV guys online. Ad agency folks will tell you that there's more demand for Web video ads--for a local station's site, the ad snippet preceding, say, sports highlights--than there is inventory. The growth of these ads may not make up all the money local TV players would lose should many viewers forsake their local station for streamed or downloaded shows. But given the high prices online video ads command, they might get close.
2006^  Six years after the Internet bust dashed hopes that original movies and shows would fly in cyberspace, online production is back. And it's not being fueled by Hollywood suits and high-priced directors who crowded the Net in 1999. Today a small army of computer jockeys from Santa Monica to Brooklyn is quietly creating a New Hollywood by conjuring up hundreds of short bursts of animated or live-action entertainment from their second bedrooms or kitchen tables. Companies are taking notice, placing products in the films themselves or running ads next to the videos. Going a step further, companies eager to connect with a younger audience are hiring these new filmmakers to create commercials. It's a tough way to make a living. Free content on the internet drives the price down for even the hottest pros cranking out films for the Web.
2006^  The dilemma facing any owner of copyrighted works continues to be how to compete with free given that the unauthorized use of online of books, music, and videos is still rampant. But Mohen's plan is to offer music free and still ensure that the record labels get paid. The concept? Sell advertising and offer music companies the bulk of those revenues. To help woo Madison Avenue, Mohen hired Robin Kent, a former chairman of ad giant Universal McCann Worldwide, to be his CEO, and SpiralFrog was born. SpiralFrog is one of a handful of new services introduced in the past two months that offer music, videos, and, in one case, books for free in exchange for users having to view advertising.
2006^  Their knack for numbers has helped turn the Internet into an advertising sensation. No medium before has been able to provide advertisers with such detailed information on how many people see an ad--and how many respond to it with a click. This apparent precision has helped hoist Google Inc. into the stratosphere. And it has powered phenomenal growth across Internet advertising, from banner ads on smart-alecky blogs to movie videos jumping out from Yahoo!'s home page. But not all the Internet numbers tell the truth. The same technology that's smart enough to target ads automatically, and to count them, can also be engineered to churn out false clicks by the millions. And concerns about privacy are leading an estimated 10% of Web surfers to erase their Internet cookies on a regular basis. The race is on to find new ways to track customer behavior. Advertisers and agencies are tracking the to-and-froing of the mouse on Web pages, and they're finding new ways to group shoppers by age, Zip Code, and reading habits.
2006^  The typical Fendi ad is beautifully styled and impeccably shot, but totally static-models toting $2,000 handbags are frozen two-dimensionally on glossy pages. That's all changing in late September when Fendi's first video ad goes live on Style.com, the online home of Vogue and W magazines, just in time for the Italian fashion shows. The video will be peppered across the site, jumping out as a full-screen pop-up and rolling as a 15-second clip before Style.com's videos of the collections. Fendi is just one of a bevy of luxury-goods retailers, including Valentino Fashion Group and Bottega Veneta, that Style.com has recently lured onto the Web. The six-year-old site attracted 88 advertisers to ply next season's swingy spring dresses online during September's New York Fashion Week, a 54% jump over last year. Designers, who rack up $14 billion in sales annually, realize they need to follow the changing habits of customers, who increasingly are snapping up the latest must-haves online.
2006^  With all the hubbub around Google Inc.'s purchase of YouTube Inc., it's easy to think that three-minute, streaming clips mark the culmination of the online video revolution. The next few months will see the unveiling of a slew of innovative approaches to dishing up video. They range from the much anticipated launch of something called the Venice Project, by the founders of Skype Ltd., the Internet phone service, to the rebirth of BitTorrent, the video piracy software of choice as a legitimate business. Rather than join the 150 YouTube video-sharing clones dishing up short, static-ridden videos, the Venice Project is tackling the problem of streaming long videos of nearly high-definition-TV quality in a cost-effective way.
2006^  YouTube Inc. is the Internet company to beat these days. With all the excitement, it's easy to forget that the video-sharing pioneer's business so far amounts to a whole lot of expenses, not much revenue, and no profits. Because the company is charting a delicate course in how it handles pirated videos, its legal costs could balloon if lawsuits start piling up. Even more important, though, is the tricky question of how YouTube can make money off its phenomenal growth while maintaining the promise behind that popularity. YouTube could easily alienate its users by overwhelming them with ads. And the startup has to figure out how to attract a broader group of marketers by filtering more for copyrighted or offensive videos and by creating more channels of similar content.
2006^  YouTube is evolving into a sort of eBay for video: the first place you go to find a clip, but also a place where more folks are itching to get rewarded for supplying it. A growing group of creative types is furiously producing clips, video blogs, and animated shorts with the hopes of making money through advertising or selling DVDs. While YouTube promises huge distribution, the site and its users are just starting to sort out how to apportion the power they've suddenly acquired. Bob Tur's lawsuit shows the fine line that YouTube is walking as it attempts to build its business model. Tur is suing because his videos of the Los Angeles riot and other events were uploaded without his permission. Although lawyers agree that YouTube should be protected by copyright law as long as it responds to content owners' requests to take down their works, it entered uncharted territory when it recently began adding ads next to search results. The law prohibits a site from benefiting financially from infringement, but the company argues that it's protected since it doesn't sell ads against individual videos. Still, the courts haven't set clear boundaries.
2006^"  YouTube's lonelygirl15, also known as Bree, and her best (and only) pal, the schlumpy Daniel, have been starring in videos posted to YouTube since mid-June. But already lonelygirl15's YouTube ""channel"" is the second most subscribed to of all time, and each video elicits thousands of viewer comments. Bree and Daniel are proof that a secret-handshake-styled series of short videos can be a bona fide hit. Alas, the bookish and cute Bree is not real. Or at least not what she purports to be. A hot and near obsessive debate about all this is playing out in video responses posted to YouTube and on countless blogs. Early chatter suggested a few theories: The videos were a corporation's viral marketing campaign; a teaser for an unknown major entertainment property; or something dreamed up by an obscure Christian sect, occultists, or Scientologists. None of this, by the way, affects the genius-in-miniature of the ongoing lonelygirl15 saga, or its triumph as a new form. No soap opera was ever this good."
2007^60Frames will provide professional video creators with financing for their projects, secure advertising to appear alongside the clips, and distribute the videos online through video-sharing sites and other Internet-based services. The company plans to focus on short-form content, including serialized sketch comedies. Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen will be the first video creators 60Frames works with.
2007^"A new crop of Web entertainment sites has popped up in recent months, many of them featuring scripted, episodic short-form content known as ""webisodes."" The online offerings include Web sites that feature video shorts, such as Break.com; scripted original series such as ""quarterlife,"" a 36-episode series from top TV producers Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, known for the series ""thirtysomething""; and ""Prom Queen,"" the Web-only drama produced by former Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner. One of Break's most popular shows is a series it licensed from General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal unit called ""Hot Crush"" featuring two young women breaking things. A recent two-minute episode features the duo throwing and dropping items frozen with liquid nitrogen, such as watermelons. While that series doesn't run with advertising pre- or post-clip, the site overall is dotted with ads for a coming Sony movie, ""Walk Hard,"" and the TBS show ""Frank TV."" Mydamnchannel.com is running channels created by personalities with Hollywood street cred, like Harry Shearer, who voices several characters on ""The Simpsons."" Mydamnchannel CEO and former MTV executive Rob Barnett says he supports the writers' demands and hopes the strike will bring in more viewers. ""When there is nothing but repeats [on television], people will go searching for alternatives,"" he says. Mr. Shearer says those who do will notice the difference, both creatively and commercially. ""No homogenization due to network and studio interference,"" he says. ""No being bombarded with multiple- minute ""pods"" of 15-second ads and promos."""
2007^"Another big marketer that was reported as cutting spending on measured media was Johnson &amp; Johnson, down 20% overall. Much of the cut occurred in J&amp;J's national TV budget -- which accounts for 60% of the company's total ad spending. The national TV budget was down 25%, or $254 million, while ""measured"" Web spending rose slightly. The TV cutback follows J&amp;J's decision last year to sit out the ""upfront"" TV ad-sales market -- where networks sell most of their ad inventory. J&amp;J said this week it planned to sit out this year's upfront as well. ""As a matter of policy we do not comment on ad spending,"" a spokesman for J&amp;J says. Cable's overall slowdown also reflects a shift of marketers to newer media, media buyers say. Advertisers looking for niche or high-profile audiences such as young men ""were the first to migrate to cable and now those advertisers are moving from cable and broadcast to the Internet,"" says John Spiropoulos, vice president, group research director at Publicis Groupe's MediaVest. ""You can take some money from cable and get a similar reach from the Internet."" TNS's report also is likely to confirm some viewers' suspicions about the amount of product placement -- particularly in reality shows such as Fox's ""American Idol"" and NBC's ""The Biggest Loser."" TNS estimated that in an hour of a reality show, 55% of the time would be taken up either by commercials or by program scenes that included appearances by different brands. Judges on ""American Idol,"" for instance, drink from cups marked prominently with the name of show sponsor Coke."
2007^"CBS could announce as early as today agreements which will make available to these portals previously aired full episodes of shows such as ""NCIS,"" ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" the ""Evening News with Katie Couric"" and certain sports programming. Aside from MSN, a unit of Microsoft Corp., and AOL, a unit of Time Warner Inc., the New York media company is also expected to announce an agreement with Joost, an online-video service founded by the creators of the Internet-telephone service Skype. CBS will become the first broadcast network to sign with Joost. CBS's increased distribution could give it ammunition if it tries to negotiate a favorable deal with YouTube, the biggest video site on the Web with more than one billion videos streamed each month. CBS has tried to strike a broad, multiyear licensing deal with YouTube, but talks have fallen apart over such matters as licensing fees and the forcefulness of YouTube's efforts to police pirated clips."
2007^"""Cognizance"" is one of hundreds of movies known as ""brickfilms"" that are getting attention on YouTube and other video-sharing sites. Amateur filmmakers use Lego pieces to create characters and scenes, sometimes spending months painstakingly arranging and rearranging the blocks before the camera. Re-creations of famous moments in ""Star Wars"" and ""Titanic,"" faithfully rendered in the primary colors of Lego pieces and stitched together from thousands of stop-motion frames, have drawn hundreds of thousands of viewings. Many of the productions are original films with elaborate plotlines, soundtracks and voice- overs. ""I was still in junior high, playing with Legos, and the Internet and I collided,"" says Robinson Wood, 18, of San Jose, Calif., whose ""Frankenstein"" and ""Grace"" are often cited by fans as classic brickfilms. In Mr. Wood's plastic retelling of Mary Shelley's monster tale -- which some viewers have found too violent for a film made from children's toys -- he used red clay to simulate blood, and achieved the sound of breaking glass by dropping a peanut butter jar eight feet onto concrete. As brickfilmers try to one-up one another with increasingly creative special effects, they find themselves drawing from an unusual list of household items. Artists realized that they could simulate shattered glass by slowly cutting apart plastic wrap, or a clear sheet of sugar. In Lewis Chen's ""Repent,"" one shootout briefly goes into ""bullet time,"" a slow-motion effect made popular in the movie ""The Matrix,"" in which a character floats through the air while dodging enemy fire. The 21-year-old Arcadia, Calif., college student says his 15-minute film took him six months to make."
2007^"""Every e-commerce company today is a new-media company tomorrow,"" says John Textor, chief executive of Baby Universe Inc., which recently launched video, accompanied by display ads, on its Web site. He says cost pressures are eroding online retailers' traditional fear that display ads will distract users there to shop. ""Advertising margins are considerably stronger than e-commerce margins."" For other sites, video offers a chance to engage and entertain shoppers. Liberty Media's BuyCostumes.tv features more than 100 clips of costume-clad models, both kids and adults, walking across a stage at a local studio. Two hosts comment on topics like how a superhero's removable mask makes his costume a sensible choice for a party where food will be served. The site will soon launch a feature that allows users to upload their own costume commentaries as well, hoping the feature will generate interest and repeat sales. ""Video helps us convey that jewelry is like a haute-couture dress,"" says Shmuel Gniwisch, chief executive of Ice.com. ""We want people to feel like they are buying a lifestyle."""
2007^"Google Inc.'s YouTube has become the top video-sharing site with millions of offbeat user-created videos, emerging hit series like LonelyGirl15 -- and untold numbers of illegally posted television and movie clips. Earlier this year, Viacom Inc., the parent of Comedy Central and MTV, sued Google, accusing the search giant of copyright infringement ""on a huge scale"" over the vast hoard of Viacom clips that users have uploaded to YouTube. Google has countered that it is protected by provisions of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which shields Internet companies from liability for copyright infringements by their users if the companies act promptly to remove the clips. Kara Swisher talked with Philippe Dauman, Viacom's president and CEO, and Walt Mossberg spoke with Google Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Schmidt about the lawsuit. MR. DAUMAN: Well, it's a very imperfect system. After we started sending take-down notices, the week before the lawsuit was filed, do you know what was the No. 1 clip on YouTube? It was a South Park clip. Now in the meantime we're making our content available everywhere. We have today over 200 sites. We'll probably have over 1,000 a year from now. We want to be everywhere. We'd love to be eventually on YouTube. MR. DAUMAN: I think consumers will find great content wherever it is. If they want it, they'll find it on our sites, they'll find it on Yahoo. They'll find it everywhere. Consumers will gravitate toward high-quality content. Yes, user-generated content's great, TV shows are great, movies are great. People want a variety of things. We're focused on what we do best."
2007^Google Inc.'s YouTube said it will expand a pilot program to put advertising in its online videos, giving more users a shot to make money from their homemade videos.
2007^"HOW TO FIND IT: On YouTube.com, search for ""Nosferatu rescore"" for ""Nosferatu,"" ""Voyage threetails"" for ""Le Voyage Dans la Lune"" and ""JynxHauser"" for Ms. [Jessica Schreiber]'s videos. ""Nosferatu,"" the 1922 Muranu vampire classic, is one of the most frequently re-scored by professionals and amateurs alike. The most interesting amateur ""Nosferatu"" rescoring on YouTube is a series that adds sound effects -- footfalls, a creaking coffin lid -- and a modern-classical score that includes synthesizers and the occasional electric-guitar chord. The result prompts viewers to watch the clips as they would a modern horror movie."
2007^In a demonstration, ScanScout's system displayed an ad for a sports- car brand at the bottom of a video clip as the people on screen were discussing that type of car. Consumers can click on the ad to pause the playback and see a video commercial, or be taken to the advertiser's Web site. By analyzing a video's content, ScanScout can help companies steer clear of subject matter and language that make them uncomfortable, potentially increasing the confidence of traditional advertisers in buying ads on amateur videos. It can also place multiple ads on a given video clip as what is being discussed changes, something that could let Internet companies tap additional ad dollars. ScanScout is already gaining some traction with customers. Online video site PureVideo Networks Inc. of El Segundo, Calif., says it plans to begin testing ScanScout, probably with standup comedy videos on its StupidVideos.com site. Blip Networks Inc. of New York has tested ScanScout on its blip.tv video site since the fall, and Chief Executive Mike Hudack says he believes it is more effective than just matching ads with the descriptive information the videos' creators supply. ScanScout co-founder and President Waikit Lau says his company lets advertisers pick categories of videos they want to target, in addition to having their ads appear alongside specific key words. He says ScanScout will at least initially tap nonvideo ads, such as graphical and text ads, to appear alongside videos to compensate for any shortage of video advertisements. And Mr. Lau says Web sites can run their high-priced ads as well as the ones from ScanScout, since its ads appear only intermittently during the clips.
2007^"In a video posted on Superpages.com for Kent Floral in Kent, Wash., the camera pans a flower shop where a baby holds a yellow flower and an announcer declares, ""We're not your typical dot-com florist."" Lora Cree, the shop's owner, said she bought the video ad to let customers know her store wasn't simply an order-taking service. The video was made by a crew hired by Superpages.com; she had some input on the content. At the same time, advertisers have to be careful that they don't hurt business with ads that look too cheesy. Some directory businesses hire videographers who try to steer advertisers away from content that might turn off consumers. But it doesn't always work. Some of the ads look like snippets of infomercials with shots of cheery employees answering phones at a beauty salon, for example. Directory companies try to avoid problems by screening ads to make sure they're G-rated and include basic information about businesses. ""The ad shows customers the quality we deliver,"" said Mr. [Achmar]. ""And once they see the video they don't have to go further browsing through the Web site or have to do any reading anymore."""
2007^"In recent weeks, Universal Pictures has posted several deleted scenes from the comedy online, advertising ""restricted clips"" in Web ads and the bonus material on television, too. Since then, the clips have racked up more than one million viewings combined on the film's official Web site and YouTube, where fans have copied and traded the clips. One scene, in which a ""Knocked Up"" character elaborately details his desire for more graphic sex between male actors in the movie ""Brokeback Mountain,"" has been viewed at least 493,000 times on YouTube. ""Knocked Up"" has already earned at least $73 million in U.S. tickets, more than any other R-rated comedy since Twentieth Century Fox's ""Borat."" For a circle of comedy writers and actors that includes Mr. Ferrell and ""Knocked Up"" director Judd Apatow, the allure of online comedy is hard to resist. Universal has quietly allowed more leaked material intended for the ""Knocked Up"" DVD to appear on the humor-video site funnyordie.com, founded by Mr. Ferrell and director Adam McKay. The scenes, in which ""Arrested Development"" actor Michael Cera and ""Spider-Man"" hunk James Franco (from Mr. Apatow's cult-favorite TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"") get into screaming matches with the director on the set of ""Knocked Up,"" were filmed as part of a mock documentary that Universal says it plans to include in a re-edited form on the DVD. Thus far, viewers have watched the clips more than 409,000 times, according to funnyordie.com. On Tuesday, the band's coming out with its sixth studio album, ""Icky Thump,"" available for streaming at theleak.mtv.com. Reviewers have lauded the title track's ""huge dinosaur-rock riffage"" and the band's return to more sonic experimentation. But the album also represents a commercial test: The color-coordinated pair's last studio release, ""Get Behind Me Satan,"" sold fewer than half as many copies as its previous effort, according to Nielsen SoundScan."
2007^"IN THE LATEST sign of the influence of YouTube-style videos, Steven Bochco, the creator of hit TV shows like ""L.A. Law"" and ""NYPD Blue,"" is trying a new medium with a series of short, unscripted videos on the Web. Many of the anecdotes have sexual themes, including an entire category devoted to ""my first time,"" and sometimes feature off-color jokes and commentary. Mr. Bochco says he was looking for a topic that young people would be ""universally attracted to."" ""It's the antithesis of what I'm doing in my day job,"" Mr. Bochco says. ""It's just challenging to try and figure out in a different medium, that really has a different expectation."""
2007^"Jason Martell, a 25-year-old self-described political junkie in Lena, Wis., is using MySpace to try to contact presidential candidates about a plan he has posted on his MySpace page for reducing energy consumption. Last week, he posted a note in the comments section of Mrs. [Hillary Clinton]'s MySpace page urging people -- Mrs. Clinton included -- to check out the plan. Mr. Martell, who is unemployed, also has sent personal notes to ""friends"" of Mrs. Clinton's on MySpace, asking them to pass his plan on to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Martell, who hasn't heard back from Mrs. Clinton or her campaign, doesn't think the candidates' MySpace pages are substantively different from, say, their own campaign Web sites. ""I think they're just advertising themselves,"" he says. Still, he says he thinks the pages nonetheless improve his chances of getting his message across to Mrs. Clinton and other candidates. YouTube and other Web sites say they don't plan to stop users from posting negative videos or comments. ""There's going to be a degree of unpredictability"" on the Internet, says Jordan Hoffner, YouTube's director of content partnerships. ""That's the nature of the medium we're in."""
2007^"Mr. [Eric Schmidt] said the Internet giant continues to pursue deals that will let it show media companies' copyright content on YouTube but said there is a ""genuine disagreement."" Traditional media argue their content has a certain intrinsic value, while [Google] says ""prove it,"" he said, speaking at a Bear Stearns investor conference yesterday. ""That's often a difficult conversation."""
2007^"One late afternoon last week, seven writers and editors were slouched around the writing-room at CollegeHumor.com's Manhattan office, bouncing around ideas for their next original online comedy video short. ""A meat-based poker game called High Steaks Poker?"" one chimes. Lame, is the collective verdict. A ""Miami Vice""-inspired re- enactment of the game ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"" Bingo. CollegeHumor's expansion into video programming is a harbinger for what Barry Diller's IAC has in store for the rest of its Internet media conglomerate, a portfolio of some 65 brands. While user- generated content, from pet-tricks to video rants, has captured much of the buzz around video online to date, Mr. Diller is betting on a different formula: featuring professionally produced, ad-supported video clips geared toward highly targeted audiences. In addition to kicking off CollegeHumor's original content, Mr. Diller is launching 23/6, a multimedia comedy news site whose name is a spoof on the phrase ""24/7."" He's also adding original online-only content to HSN.com, the home shopping network Web site. That's not stopping Mr. Diller from making an aggressive push into an area he knows well. IAC's president of programming, Michael Jackson, poached some TV talent to run 23/6, which is a partnership with the Huffington Post, a left-leaning news and opinion site. The site, with a launch planned for March, will be edited by Daley Haggar, a comedian and writer who has worked on shows like Comedy Central's ""South Park"" and NBC's ""The Apprentice."""
2007^"Such systems aren't foolproof, though. A recent search with the keywords ""[Britney Spears] and Paris"" turned up a video on Revver purporting to show ""Paris Hilton nude on the beach in st tropez."" The short clip didn't include any video of the celebrity heiress. In fact, it was an otherwise blank screen with a bit of text; alongside the video box was a description consisting of about 200 misleading keywords ranging from sexually explicit terms to ""ESPN"" and ""Microsoft."" After the 28-second clip, there suddenly appeared an ad for a Palm Inc. product. ""This is totally misleading,"" acknowledged Revver's founder and chief executive, Steven Starr. But ""this happens very, very infrequently,"" he added. Revver removed the clip yesterday after a reporter for this newspaper pointed it out. A Palm spokeswoman said she ""contacted Revver to express our surprise and displeasure, and clearly Palm and Revver agreed that the content was inappropriate."" A clip titled ""Hot Blonde Tells You How She Wants to . . .,"" which directed users to a site telling ""How to Make Buckets of Cash"" had garnered almost 500,000 views by yesterday and ascended to the No. 6 slot on the ""Top 10"" list featured on Google Video. The video's creator attached more than 100 misleading keywords, including sexually explicit terms and ""Harry Potter."" It Is possible that some users were actually interested in seeing the site's pitchwoman, but it Is likely that others were misled into watching it."
2007^"Take General Electric's ""ecomagination"" campaign promoting the company's green energy and technology initiatives. Web surfers who checked out AOL News, Yahoo News or MSNBC.com on the afternoon of May 24 saw a live video featuring GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at a ""Green is Universal"" news conference discussing energy issues. The video played on 95,000 people's computers, and even though it was appearing on news sites, it clearly wasn't a news story. It was part of an ad. GE is one of a growing number of marketers to use videos of live events to spice up banner ads. ""We're always trying to do something a little more innovative and entertaining and be more influential,"" says Jen Walsh, digital media director for GE. ""Year over year we try to push the envelope with technology, content and design. Broadcasting [online video through an ad] achieves that."" To be sure, some marketers question whether redesigning the banner ad is worth it. The ads might temporarily catch a Web surfer's eye because people haven't yet trained themselves to ignore them, but could easily fall into ranks of yet another ignored banner ad or a hated pop-up, says Greg Verdino, chief strategy officer at independently owned new-media marketing firm crayon. ""I think the first natural inclination for advertisers and agencies is for them to innovate within the four walls of the space that they've been given before you look to innovate by breaking that space and doing something that's truly first to the market,"" Mr. Verdino says."
2007^"The clips, which run up to 60 seconds long, will assemble memorable moments from the movies, grouped under categories like ""Leia Confronts Vader"" and ""The Lost Limbs"" -- the latter a collection of various characters' limbs getting the chop. One category devoted to a much- maligned lizard-like character from the three ""Star Wars"" prequels urges fans: ""Don't be shy. Here's your chance to edit Jar Jar."" That notion may not resonate with fans who remember Mr. [George Lucas]'s reactions to other attempts to draw on his movies for inspiration. Last year, Lucasfilm sued a Maryland company that was making ""Star Wars""-like light sabers without the proper trademarks. Previously, it sued rapper Dr. Dre for using the booming sound effect that begins Lucasfilm movies to kick off his album ""2001."" And it also sued to block distribution of an animated pornographic movie called ""Starballz"" that featured some ""Star Wars""-like characters. The company says this situation is different. If fans are using ""Star Wars"" material for fun, that's one thing. ""If someone tries to commercialize it, that's where we've drawn the line,"" says Mr. [Jeffrey Ulin]. He says the company has long supported activities like an annual contest for the best ""Star Wars"" movie submitted by a fan; Mr. Lucas will pick this year's winner on Sunday at the ""Celebration IV"" ""Star Wars"" convention in Los Angeles."
2007^"The fight began to brew last year, when the West coast ATAS began handing out ""broadband Emmys."" The Los Angeles group objected that one nominee was a version of the prime-time show ""24"" made for cellphones, called a ""mobisode."" That's a prime-time show, ATAS argued. East coast NATAS retorted: On the Internet, what's prime time? On Friday, March 16, the Los Angeles group's attorney George Hedges sent an email proposing that the two groups should agree to a ""mutual standstill"" on any new Emmy award ceremonies. ""The proposed standstill would apply to any ongoing or new projects involving new media content (including MySpace etc.),"" wrote Mr. Hedges, of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver &amp; Hedges LLP in Los Angeles. ""Both organizations have as a goal the working out a system to give Emmy awards for appropriate broadband programming,"" Dixon Dern, general counsel for the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Science. ""But for the West Coast to agree to that, we have to know that the Emmy will be protected."""
2007^The first devices for moving Internet content to TVs from PCs, sometimes called media adapters, haven't sold well so far. PCs adapted for playing downloaded videos on TVs also haven't made much headway, despite the high-profile backing of Intel Corp., under an initiative called Viiv. Rivals, by contrast, see Web-delivered video as a way to neutralize the cable industry's ability to deliver video on demand. AT&amp;T Inc., for example, at the CES plans to show the latest version of Homezone, a combined satellite-TV and Internet-video service introduced last year. It offers a set-top box that receives EchoStar Communications Corp.'s Dish Network service and downloads video content off the Web. DirecTV Group, another large U.S. satellite-TV operator, has developed a high-definition set-top box that allows subscribers to retrieve photos and music from computers using Viiv technology. Sony Corp. allows users of the PlayStation 3 to do the same thing, though with a shorter menu. Users now can only get trailers and game demo movies from its so-called PlayStation Store on the Web. But the new game console comes with a browser that allows people to roam to sites such as YouTube and watch its videos on TV. Nintendo Co.'s Wii device can also surf the Web for videos or other content, but the company hasn't emphasized that particular use.
2007^"The first episodes harken back to proven hits, from the high-school melodrama of Fox's ""The O.C."" to the typecasting of the horror movie ""Scream."" A more direct precedent might be Lonelygirl15, the extremely popular YouTube personality who seemed to hint at an eerie family backstory in her bedroom videos (which turned out to be concocted by a pair of filmmakers). ""Prom Queen"" gets off to a provocative start. A young woman wakes up in the grass, distraught and in her underwear. Inside, she contemplates a handful of pills and discovers a video camera in her bedroom. When she says ""Oh, God,"" her British accent comes as a surprise -- until we learn, in episode two, that she's an exchange student who is fascinated by the prom."
2007^"The online show, called ""News at Seven,"" uses an automated computer program to comb online news outlets for major stories of the day and to pair them with video and still photos culled from sites like Google Images and YouTube. The newscast is delivered by an avatar -- a digital representation of a person."
2007^"""There's a huge lack of high-quality inventory to sponsor,"" says Michael Shehan, chief executive officer of online video-ad network SpotXchange, a unit of Booyah Networks, which has run ads for the film ""1408"" and for companies like SunTrust Banks on Voxant's network of niche Web sites. Voxant has a team of researchers who spend much of their time searching for obscure Web sites in areas like sports, entertainment, news, health and business. It has a separate team of people who monitor those sites for offensive language or images. Sites that violate Voxant's decency policies, or those of its clients, are quickly pulled off the roster, says Voxant CEO, Jeffrey Crigler. A handful of companies are trying to fill the middleman function that Voxant provides. But the Reston, Va., company is one of the few that has struck deals with about 230 publishers including the AP, BBC and The Wall Street Journal, a unit of Dow Jones. When a Web site decides to embed a news story from Voxant, Voxant and the news provider each receive 40% of the revenue; the Web site receives the other 20%."
2007^"The video blog ""Rocketboom,"" for instance, has been delivering three-minute news programs five days a week since October 2004. ""Grammar Girl,"" a popular podcast about proper language usage, gets an update every Thursday like clockwork. That regular schedule is crucial to the podcast's creator, Mignon Fogarty. ""When the shows I listen to don't come out, I get very frustrated,"" she says. Now Ms. Fogarty is exploring new niches. In addition to her own show, she now produces six other advice podcasts featuring other people -- including ""Mighty Mommy,"" about parenting, ""Money Girl,"" about finances, and ""Legal Lad,"" about the law. The network gets about a million downloads a month. Much slicker looking is the video podcast ""Ask a Ninja."" In each episode, a black-clad performer uses questions from viewers to launch comic riffs on the legendary Japanese assassins. In a recent show, a viewer asked, ""Do ninjas write poetry or are they just murderous shadows of death put on earth only to act against mankind?"" Answer: ""Wow, I didn't realize those were the only two options."""
2007^"Three of his favorite shows -- ""The O.C."" on Fox, ""Scrubs"" on NBC and ""Grey's Anatomy"" on ABC -- all aired on Thursday at 9 p.m. this past fall. So Mr. [Adan Canizales], a New York University law student, devised an elaborate solution. He watched ""The O.C."" on TV and recorded ""Scrubs"" on his TiVo digital video recorder. But since his TiVo can't record two shows at once, he later opened his laptop to watch ""Grey's Anatomy"" online. Fox: Fox on Demand introduced free, ad-supported shows this fall to its www.myspace.com/fox page and on MyFoxLocal station sites in 24 markets. Viewers can stream previously aired episodes of eight shows, including ""Prison Break"" and ""Bones,"" which are updated after their TV broadcast. Some popular shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""House"" aren't available, although a seven-minute preview of ""The Simpsons"" drew 1.4 million hits over three days in September. The MySpace site also provides interactive options, with links to the show's official site. NBC: Full episodes of six NBC shows, including ""30 Rock"" and ""Friday Night Lights,"" are accessible on its NBC Rewind video-streaming site at www.nbc.com/Video/rewind/. Like the other networks, shows are divided into segments by nonskippable ads. Every full episode is available for some shows, such as ""Heroes."" But some of NBC's most popular series, such as ""The Office,"" ""Scrubs"" and ""E.R.,"" aren't offered, other than in two-minute replays."
2007^To help recoup some of their expenses, they made an arrangement with YouTube to show the entire film (the normal limit is 10 minutes), and struck an agreement with Spout.com, a movie recommendation site. For every new member that joins Spout by following a link on the film's YouTube page, Spout will give the filmmakers $1. So far, they say they have made more than $30,000.
2007^"TV SHOWS from ""Will &amp; Grace"" to ""ER"" have broadcast live episodes to pump up ratings. Now that strategy has come to the Web with a new drama streaming live in prime time. Producer Kathryn Jones says that, until now, live content on the Web has been limited to ""some sports, some politicians, and a lot of people at desks with microphones."" Ms. Jones, who also stars in ""35,"" says the creators wanted to mix the accessibility of Web TV with the spontaneity of theater."
2007^"""We're trying to keep our character palate as balanced as possible,"" says 29-year-old Eric Socolofsky, leader of the three-man creative team behind the site, which he calls a hobby. The unrefined visual aesthetic is meant to have a ""clip art"" sensibility, he says, drawing inspiration from popular online comics like ""Get Your War On"" and ""Red Meat."" Their goal, in part, was to manufacture a new user-generated Internet trend. ""I wanted to try working on a viral Web project,"" says 27-year-old Mr. [Ahmad Saeed], who designed the Quickcomic database. For Mr. Socolofsky, who thought up the concept, Quickcomic is a tool for expression. ""I've taken part in protests, both physically and digitally,"" he says, although these experiences often left him feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. With Quickcomic, Mr. Socolofscy envisioned something ""a bit lighter, a bit humorous and a bit more approachable."" Despite this political aim, early comic creators haven't focused exclusively on political topics. ""I'd say we mostly see people being ridiculous and apolitical,"" says Mr. Socolofsky of the more than 600 comics on the site so far. ""Of the rest, I'd say it leans to the left. But we don't encourage people to express one kind of political view or another."""
2007^"While newspapers have had success building heavily trafficked Web sites, ""people still don't automatically think to visit a TV-station Web site,"" says Brent Magid, chief executive officer of media consultancy Frank Magid Associates Inc. ""Stations need to do something online to get noticed."" WITN, a Greenville, N.C., station owned by Gray Television Group Inc., is hosting video tours of houses for sale on its Web site, while Nashville's WKRN, owned by Young Broadcasting Inc., started blogs on everything from religion to hunting. Meredith Corp.'s WNEM in Flint, Mich., produced a whole program -- a type of senior-citizen talent show, including a voting element a la ""American Idol"" -- for its site. Prompting station executives to shift to an ""always on"" mentality -- breaking news on the Web around the clock -- has been hard, says Jonathan Leess, president of CBS Stations Digital Media Group.""They needed to understand that this is a threat,"" he says. ""If they continued with a holding-back approach it will severely limit their growth."""
2007^"With ""KateModern,"" however, the creators aren't trying to hide the fact that a professional team is behind the scenes. Among the ""friends"" listed on the character Kate's Web page, there's a link to ""KateModern Production."""
2007^"  About a month ago, Google caused barely a ripple when it unveiled technology to filter out copyright violations on its YouTube video Web site. After all, YouTube had been under constant fire from big media companies for hosting unauthorized clips. But now a move by AT&amp;T to adopt similar technology across its entire broadband network is raising the hackles of critics. The phone company is in talks with NBC Universal and Walt Disney about embedding a ""content-recognition"" system made by tiny Vobile Inc right into AT&amp;T's Internet transmission apparatus. The technology would be used to guard against illegal distribution of those companies' shows and films. Critics fear that by assigning a phone carrier a gatekeeper role over a broad portion of the Internet--some experts say half of US Net traffic may touch AT&amp;T's network--the system would threaten users' privacy, freedom of speech, and equal access."
2007^  As Disney prepares for the August TV debut of High School Musical 2, that other kiddie music juggernaut, Kidz Bop, is pushing beyond its CD genre. Razor &amp; Tie is expanding the brand. Kidz Bop's recently redesigned Web site emphasizes music videos, many made by 6-to-12-year-olds, who upload directly a la YouTube. Traffic quadrupled during the new site's first two weeks, when there were more than 1.3 million video-clip streamings by 400,000 unique users.
2007^  By the end of May, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) will report to its member studios the results of tests of a dozen computerized video-fingerprinting systems. This technology is designed to identify pirated movies wherever they exist on the Internet, automating a job that is now done by staffers who look for infringing clips with their own eyes. Fingerprinting systems could be a crucial link in the battle to control video content on the Net.
2007^"  Fidelity Investments' Web site features a new educational effort, dubbed the Trading Knowledge Center. The advice is solid, the graphics cutting-edge, and the terrific-looking video tutorials deliver sometimes arcane material in easy-to-digest pieces. Each module contains links to well-produced short videos, typically three to four minutes in length. Narrated by professional actors and market experts, they're a cut above most video on the Internet. The advice and explanations run the gamut from the incredibly basic (""options are contracts between a buyer and a seller"") to the nitty-gritty of complex trading strategies (""the classic whipsaw scenario in which a short, sharp price reversal stops you out"")."
2007^  Forget the powerful companies that are pouring money into new ways to bring TV into the Internet Age. Some video gamers have figured out their own solution. Using features pre-installed in their game consoles, they call up software from Orb Networks that lets them view Web sites, YouTube videos, or digital music collections on big-screen TVs. Don't try this at home if you aren't a real techie. Orb's controls and setup are plenty complicated.
2007^  For the last several years, Finnish handset giant Nokia has been on a furious shopping spree. It spent $60 million on a rival to Apple iTunes called Loudeye, the largest independent music distributor on the Net, and followed that up by acquiring navigation software maker gate5 and media-sharing site Twango. Now it's clear what the buying binge was all about. At an Aug 29, 2007 press conference, Nokia unveiled plans to launch a slew of services for mobile users, starting later this year in Europe and Asia. The scheme includes an online music store aimed at the 200 million music-capable Nokia mobile phones already on the market, an interactive multiplayer game service, and a new venue for Nokia handset users to swap photos, videos, and music. It's the most ambitious bid by a phonemaker to spin profits out of content and services.
2007^  Give it up for NBC Universal and News Corp., because in late March the two old-media titans made the biggest splash for a nonexistent product since the iPhone. News Corp. and NBC Universal have nothing to show for their ambitious Web video destination site and service (not even a name, so I'll call it NewTube), aside from syndication agreements with Yahoo!, Microsoft's MSN.com, and Time Warner's America Online, along with a fairly detailed business brief. Among other things, NewTube's videos can be embedded on any site, YouTube-style. But unlike YouTube thus far, they'll come with Big Media-approved copyright protection and, at least in some cases, a small share of ad revenues. For media geeks, NewTube (its executives, unsurprisingly, prefer the clunkier handles NewCo or NewSite) is big news. But the venture, expected to launch this summer, is merely one of myriad developments that will remake the world of Web video in the next few months.
2007^  Having shifted much of their advertising budgets from print to online, big consumer-brand companies are increasingly attaching ads to selected words on newspaper and other media Web sites. So-called in-text advertising, purchased by companies such as Ford, Intel, and Microsoft, pops up in small windows when a reader moves a cursor over highlighted, double-underlined words in a story. Pausing over a link produces a bubble containing written pitches, voiceover, or even video. This year the Web sites of several Gannett newspapers, including The Indianapolis Star, The Arizona Republic, and the Reno Gazette-Journal, began using in-text ads. New York City-based Vibrant Media, one of the leading firms that specializes in selling in-text advertising, has nearly doubled the number of publishers showing its ads in the past year. The ongoing shift of ad dollars from print and TV to the Web has increased pressure on publishers to try unconventional formats.
2007^  Imagine a bookstore that sells only works published by Random House. If you want a HarperCollins title, you have to go to the store down the street. In this world, you're permitted to read Penguin books either on the train or lying in bed, but Vintage books can only be read on the couch. It's absurd--but no more so than the world of video downloads as they exist today. The problem is that the quickly growing stock of movies and shows available for download is scattered among an assortment of stores including Movielink, CinemaNow, Google Video, and Amazon.com Unbox, as well as Apple's iTunes Store. And while there's a lot of overlap, there's also a significant amount of content exclusive to one or another service. This has happened because the digital-download business isn't like any other sort of retailing. It's no wonder none of these download services has developed any real traction in the market.
2007^  In an echo of the tech bubble, once-iconic Internet analysts Henry Blodget and Mary Meeker are battling it out again over stock valuations. But this little rivalry involves estimates of how much Google can make by overlaying ads on videos viewed at its popular YouTube site.
2007^  In the Web world, widgets are modules of software that people can drag and drop onto the personal page of their social network or onto a blog. There, widgets typically look like a little window or box, packing a bit of the functionality that you would get with a stand-alone Web site or software package. Widgets also can be storefront windows for selling products and services or digital billoards to which customized ads can be affixed. The land grab comes from the sudden realization by software developers, media companies, and retailers that by widgetizing their programs, news snippets, video clips, and products, they can stake out some prime Web real estate. People are increasingly spending their time with like-minded souls at blogs, online communities, and social networking sites. . In a sense, creating widgets is like unleashing a cloud of benign viruses. They carry your storefront or video clip or ad to anyone's Web page or profile. And those who like them can share them with thousands of people. They multiply, and as they do, they alter the very geography of the Web. That leads some technologists to conclude that these humble bits of code - or applications, as widgets are also known - could turbocharge a third phase in the Internet's development. The scramble began on May 24, when Facebook Inc. announced it would crack open its site and hand over significant economic and distribution power to widget developers. Major companies from media, publishing, technology, communications, entertainment, and retail are jumping on the widget bandwagon. Google Inc., the most powerful force on the Web today, is taking widgets seriously. The e-commerce implications are potentially huge. Instead of simply building a destination site where people come to shop, sellers can use widgets to bring the store to the buyers.
2007^  It's the year 2014, and Googlezon, a fearsomely powerful combination of search engine Google Inc. and online store Amazon.com Inc., has crushed traditional media to bits. Taking its place is the computer-generated Evolving Personalized Information Construct--an online package of news, entertainment, blogs, and services drawn from all the world's up-to-the-minute knowledge and customized to match your preferences. And it's all collected, packaged, and controlled by Googlezon. This is the future according to EPIC 2014, a faux documentary posted to the Web in late 2004 by young journalists Matt Thompson and Robin Sloan. Thanks to their slightly tongue-in-cheek, Twilight Zone-inspired tone, the short video drew as many chuckles as gasps of dismay from the legions of mainstream media types and Web digerati who viewed it. Today, nobody's laughing. Here it is only 2007, and already EPIC 2014's picture of an online landscape dominated by one ravenous, all-knowing corporation looks to many people like--well, a lot like Google. All by itself. As the place nearly 400 million people each month start on the Internet, it's the No. 1 gateway to the Net's vast commercial potential.
2007^  It's Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif., and that means Seth Sternberg, Sandy Jen, and Elaine Wherry have retreated to Fiesta Del Mar to hold their weekly founders' lunch. But this is no ordinary week for the three friends who 21 months ago started Meebo, a new type of instant-messaging service. Just a week from now, on May 15, they're launching a product called Meebo Rooms that could boost them into the big leagues of so-called Web 2.0 companies. With a year or two under their belts, they're trying to move beyond early-adopter audiences and go mainstream. With Meebo Rooms, individuals and media companies create pages around a topic--motorcycling, say, or Bollywood movies. Then visitors can step in to chat and post videos and photos. Like YouTube videos, these rooms also can be posted on other sites and blogs.
2007^  Online video sites are now scaling back their focus on user-generated clips. What they want now is professionally produced programming. More than 57% of U.S. Internet users say they have watched or downloaded online videos, according to a July study by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project. But they're shunning home videos in favor of news and movie trailers, followed by comedy bits, music videos, and television shows, according to a study by Burst Media. Some advertisers will pay $60-plus per 1,000 views to place their ads inside professional video content, says Suranga Chandratillake of blinkx. Ads on user-generated videos, on the other hand, go for as little as $7 per 1,000 views, says Chandratillake. Meanwhile, Hollywood is flooding the Web with slick new shows, produced specifically for the Net.
2007^"  On March 13, Viacom sued YouTube for $1 billion. The Google-owned unit is ""stealing value,"" the complaint alleged, by airing snippets of shows like its Comedy Central hit South Park without paying for the right. Meanwhile, in the other part of Sumner M. Redstone's media empire, we have CBS literally cuddling up to YouTube. If CBS and Viacom have radically different approaches to the world's most popular video service, it's largely because CBS believes it needs YouTube (at least for now) and Viacom believes it doesn't (unless it gets paid). CBS and Viacom both want the same thing: a deal that allows them to leverage YouTube's mass appeal while getting paid. But hammering one out could prove maddeningly difficult. It's no secret that Google/YouTube, despite months of negotiations with a number of parties, has yet to sign a revenue-sharing contract with any major U.S. film or TV studio."
2007^  Over the past year, the telecom industry has roared back to life. Credit a steady rise in appetite for broadband Internet connections, which enable easy consumption of watch-my-cat video clips, iPod music files, and such Web-inspired services as free Internet phoning. Indeed, this year broadband adoption among U.S. adults is expected to cross the important threshold of 50%. Capital spending is on the rise as companies invest to build high-speed networks. Private equity players are placing enormous bets on the industry, such as the $8.2 billion that Silver Lake Partners and the Texas Pacific Group agreed to pay for networking gearmaker Avaya on June 5. And the glut in broadband communications capacity is all but gone. About half of the Internet's transmission capacity was going unused in 2002. Today that pipeline has almost doubled in size, and yet the unused portion is down to about 30%. As a result, the price that companies pay for bandwidth in some parts of the U.S. is on the rise after six years of declines.
2007^  Ricky Van Veen is editor-in-chief of CollegeHumor.com, a media play single-mindedly devoted to the (sophomoric) collegiate mind, and he's co-founder of its parent company, Connected Ventures. Last summer, Barry Diller's IAC bought the lion's share of Connected in a deal that valued the company substantially north of $20 million. Despite CollegeHumor's frank raciness, it has helped make ads for its site with some of the biggest brands out there, including Ford and Procter &amp; Gamble. The first ad CollegeHumor made was for a site selling kits enabling consumers to beat drug tests, back around 2001, so the outfit has come a long way. Before its sale, Connected, which also owns clothing company Busted Tees and video-sharing site Vimeo, projected it would gross $10 million in '06.
2007^  Since mid-April CBS has inked partnerships with two dozen partners--from Bebo to Veoh--to syndicate its programming online. CBS also passed on taking an equity stake in the still-unnamed Web-video site that NBC Universal and News Corp. are assembling, because that would mean exclusively syndicating shows with the venture. That stake might be huge down the road, concedes CBS CEO Leslie Moonves. But he says the point of CBS's current moves is not to have one big property with an equity upside 10 years from now. All the Web wisdom in the world won't help CBS if the hits dry up. But CBS's moves are coherent philosophically, and about as in tune with how people behave online as one may expect a traditional company to be. Whether its competitors are teeny or titans, CBS can still walk tall.
2007^  Since the beginning of April Comcast, which generates most of its $25 billion a year in revenues by delivering TV over cable, has signed a flurry of deals designed to allow it to do battle with the likes of Yahoo!, MSN, and others that intend to stream TV shows to folks' computers. It struck deals with CBS, Fox, and NBC to deliver their TV shows through Comcast's soon-to-be-launched Fancast online site. It plunked down tens of millions of dollars to buy Fandango, with a notion to turn the online ticketing site into a guide to TV shows available online. For Comcast, this sure looks like a change in strategy. Three years ago it was so hungry to add programming muscle that it was willing to pony up $54 billion to buy Disney. Now it seems desperate to join the Internet party and not be left out of the ad boom surrounding online video. Little wonder: After cable stocks' bullish run last year, investors are more nervous about the industry's prospects these days. Comcast shares are down about $3, to 27, from this year's high.
2007^  Startup download service Jaman aims to become an online film festival for world movies and the works of independent filmmakers - the sort that don't have distribution deals with Miramax Film or Fox Searchlight Pictures. Outside of Jaman, the movies available for download today are mostly a subset of the limited offerings at your local Blockbuster, dominated by films that have recently finished their theatrical runs, box-office hits of the last few years, direct-to-video flops, and just a smattering of classics. Movielink's download service offers fewer than 150 of the thousands of movies made before 1970, plus a shamefully underpowered roster of 40 foreign films. Like nearly all movie download services, Jaman requires its own software player, which is available for both Windows and Mac OS X. The image quality is very good. Jaman's business model is also a step up from other services. As befits a Web startup, Jaman offers an assortment of social networking features.
2007^  The Archos 605 Wi-Fi video player, on sale Sep 1, 2007, is reviewed. People tend to associate Archos with portable media players, but this silver-and-white model also surfs the Web, downloads content, and docks with a TV. Even novices should find it relatively easy to operate, thanks to intuitive icons on a high-quality 4.3-inch touch screen. The Archos Content Portal, represented by one of those icons, lets you download movies and TV shows from CinemaNow. There's also a music download service called BurnLounge and a link to YouTube, and Archos may announce several other content partnerships. On all models there's a built-in Web browser with Adobe Flash Player support, which improves the hunt for Web content.
2007^  The ease of showing video online has led to a deluge of video from nonmedia types everywhere. This year Ford Models began cranking out all manner of Web videos. It's far too early to know if this ends up a short-lived sideline for the 60-year-old modeling agency or becomes another way to make decent money off its picturesque assets, but it's not crazy to think that this nonmedia company may figure out new ways to make Web video work. For one thing, models require little persuading to take star turns on film. Production quality, as you might imagine, is high: Modeling agencies know from flattering angles and lighting. Ford has cut ad-sharing deals with Web partners, and the models in the videos get around 30% of Ford's net.
2007^"  The new Web video service Joost is barely in beta, but it's already subject to inhuman amounts of hype. It's not hard to see why. The service (say ""juiced"") is the next project of Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom, founders of Net phone service Skype. Its investors include Viacom and CBS. The company has just raised $45 million. On a good monitor, its satisfyingly full-screen playback looks gorgeous. Joost's executives singlemindedly stress devotion to full-length programs and their respect for copyrights."
2007^  There's a reason why Amazon hasn't done much to sell books, movies, or music in digital form, even after acquiring Paris-based Mobipocket in 2005 and unveiling its internally built Unbox movie-download service in 2006. These ventures are still more an investment in the future than a near-term profit engine. Amazon's toe-in-the-water approach may seem odd, considering how it helped pioneer online shopping in the mid-1990s. You might think that fulfilling orders for digital media would be more efficient than pulling CDs off shelves, boxing them, and handing them over to UPS for delivery. But as long as digital music and e-books come with heavy restrictions on how and where consumers can use them, the market will be limited and rights holders will have the power to shake down sellers. For Amazon, there's still much more money to be made shipping real stuff.
2007^  Video producers and would-be stars are pooling their talents and cheap digital cameras to create Wallstrip, a daily show examining top-performing stocks. The timing seems perfect, with pioneering online video series such as Rocketboom and Ask a Ninja drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers and Google Inc. snapping up YouTube for $1.65 billion. Many people are now betting that 2007 will be the year money starts flowing to top indie video creators. what really sets Wallstrip apart is its ambition in the business news arena. Wallstrip creator Howard Lindzon, a small-time hedge fund manager with an eye for Internet startups, is betting that a short, savvy, tongue-in-cheek approach will create a highly profitable niche among twenty- and thirtysomethings turned off by old-school business news. Instead of focusing on price-earnings ratios and the opinions of Wall Street analysts, most episodes of Wallstrip zero in on a single stock that has recently hit its 52-week high.
2007^  Videos from YouTube and all other streaming media sites on the Web have one big disadvantage: For all but the very tech savvy, it's difficult to download them or take them with you on the road. RealNetworks has the best solution so far. The latest version of RealPlayer, which will be available for free download by the end of June, lets you record any streaming video available on the Web that is not copy-protected and save it for offline viewing. You can even download some of the content to many handheld devices, although this is harder than it ought to be.
2008^
2008^Many viewers aren't in the habit of visiting destination sites for streaming, long-form video, preferring to watch short clips on Google Inc.'s YouTube or download full episodes from Apple Inc.'s iTunes.
2008^Microsoft Corp. placed a bold $44.6 billion bet that buying Yahoo Inc. can transform both companies' flagging efforts to catch Google Inc. The software giant's unsolicited offer for Yahoo represents a 62% premium over the Internet company's recent share price and is a sign of Microsoft's determination to narrow Google's growing lead in the online advertising and Web search-engine wars.
2008^Now our job as agencies is to put the proper message there, says Tracey Scheppach, senior vice president and video innovations director at Publicis Groupe's Starcom MediaVest, a media-buying group that works for companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Coca-Cola.
2008^"Shot with handheld cameras, ""Princess"" has an edgy look that ties into the story (cellphone videos and text messages are the character's favored communication modes), but the movie wasn't made with YouTube in mind. A joint venture of NBC and News Corp. (which owns Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal), the seven-month-old Hulu primarily streams familiar TV shows and movies, such as ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Men In Black,"" and offers tools that let viewers post these videos directly on their own blogs, Facebook pages and other sites."
2008^The New York Television Festival is an annual event where network shows premiere with full-on red-carpet treatment, and pilots from independent producers get Sundance-style screenings.
2008^"""There's going to be a lot of new business models in 2008 that are geared toward more monetization,"" says Pete Blackshaw, executive vice president of strategic services for Nielsen Online, the Web analysis unit of the Nielsen Co. Blog publishers could certainly use the help in making money."
2008^"The video services have sought protection under ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, which can shield them from liability as long they remove material when alerted by a copyright holder."
2008^While new media channels, from blogging to online video sharing, could expand viewership of the Games, they also make it more difficult for organizers to control exclusive content, for which sponsors pay millions of dollars.
2008^"  According to Dave Morgan, founder of ad network Tacoda, the most successful ad format for Web video sites has been display ads that run near video clips. Like all big online players, Google has invested serious time and dollars (the $3.1 billion DoubleClick deal, for instance) in beefing up its display-ad capabilities. YouTubers point out that most of their key ad formats - including the ""overlay"" format, which places an ad over a small portion of a video without interrupting it - have been available only since August. At ad agencies, Web video ads can be subject to tug-of-wars and turf battles between TV buyers and digital buyers. YouTube is holding contests in which users upload videos to a sponsor's page and thus, ideally, generate heat and page views for ad messages."
2008^"  Frustrated by the usual fix-it options - obediently waiting on hold with Bangalore, gamely chatting online with a scripted robot - more consumers are rebelling against company-prescribed service channels. After getting nowhere with the call center, these consumer vigilantes are sending ""e-mail carpet bombs"" to the C-suite, cc-ing the top layer of management with their complaints. When all else fails, a plucky few are going straight to the top after uncovering direct numbers to executive customer-service teams not easily found by mere mortals. And of course, they're filling up the Web with blogs and videos, leaving behind venom-spewed tales of woe. Behind the guerrilla tactics is a growing disconnect between the experience companies promise and customers' perceptions of what they actually get. Consumers already pushed to the brink by evaporating home equity, job insecurity, and rising prices are more apt to snap when hit with long hold times and impenetrable phone trees. A swell of corporate distrust - exacerbated by high executive pay, accounting lapses, and the offshoring of jobs - has people feeling more at odds with companies than ever before. Technology is aiding the uprising, empowering consumers to do much more to make themselves heard. Add a powerful media voice and a provocative site title to a blog, and it can have extraordinary impact. The biggest challenges in customer service may be dealing with consumers who are hard to mollify. For some, the sting of a bad experience cuts so deep that it transforms them from a merely upset customer into an activist no longer just looking for a refund. A recent study by market research firm Yankelovich finds that more than half of American adults think they know more about the products and services they shop for than the people helping them in the stores."
2008^  It's April, and Microsoft's top U. S. salesman for online advertising, Keith Lorizio, is visiting clients in New York City. In a midtown office tower, he sits down with Nicholas Utton, the gregarious chief marketing officer at online broker E*Trade. Utton is plenty impressed with Microsoft's technology, and he's a big advertiser on the company's MSN Money site. But when it comes to Internet search sites, the largest and most lucrative advertising market online, Utton makes it clear that Microsoft is, as he sees it, way behind front-runner Google. They're not getting much of our search dollars, he says. Lorizio's pitch just got even tougher. On May 3, Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer withdrew his offer for Web giant Yahoo!, the No. 2 power in online ads, after the two sides failed to agree on a price. Ballmer had said that the proposed acquisition, which valued Yahoo at $47.5 billion, was the best way for Microsoft to gain the scale necessary to compete against Google for online advertising dollars. Now, after three months of talks, it looks as though Microsoft and Yahoo will be left trying to catch Google on their own, at least for now. It may be impossible to catch Google in search advertising. But Microsoft has a fighting chance on several other fronts. Perhaps most important is display advertising, the colorful banner and video ads that run at the top or along the side of Web pages.
2008^  MTV Networks (MTVN) operates more than 5,000 mobile, console, and online games and virtual worlds - many of them based on TV shows such as MTV's The Real World and Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. MTVN has even cut a deal to develop new titles with Hollywood uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer of CSI and Armaggedon fame. And this isn't just about kids. The network is keen to hook the growing ranks of so-called casual gamers, including women old enough to have a couple of teenagers in the house. Total time spent gaming online hit 11.4 billion minutes in December, up 27% over the previous year, according to Web-traffic tracker comScore. Only e-mail and shopping keep people online longer nowadays. MTVN started to ratchet up its game strategy three years ago with a series of acquisitions. The company has plowed $800 million into properties that appeal to a range of ages. MTVN doesn't break out its gaming ad revenues but says it has signed up dozens of advertisers. MTVN has been putting product placements in its TV shows for years. Now it's doing the same thing online.
2008^  Nearly a year ago, NBC Universal and News Corp. launched a video site called Hulu. The Web cognoscenti scoffed at two Old Media dinosaurs taking on YouTube. But the derision has abated of late. Thanks to a huge library, Hulu is attracting millions of viewers and signing up advertisers like Bank of America, Best Buy, and Nissan. In effect, NBCU and News Corp. gambled that people are willing to watch full-length TV shows and movies online. In the Age of YouTube, that's a contrarian position. The Web video king has become ubiquitous with clips rarely more than five minutes long. YIn effect, NBCU and News Corp. gambled that people are willing to watch full-length TV shows and movies online. In the Age of YouTube, that's a contrarian position. The Web video king has become ubiquitous with clips rarely more than five minutes long. Hulu did something else unusual. Rather than forcing people to come to its site, it cut deals with portals like AOL, Comcast, MSN, and Yahoo! to show Hulu-branded video on their sites.
2008^  No fewer than six manufacturers of high-definition televisions, including Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic, Sony, and Samsung, are introducing sets this year that stay permanently connected to your home broadband network and fetch everything from sports scores and weather to videos, movies, and photos you've stored online. With all this content finally coming to the big screen in the living room, why ever leave home? Blockbuster still has a ton of movie offerings that aren't available anywhere on the Net. And people who want everything on one screen can use any number of stand-alone devices, such as Apple TV, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Plug one of these, or almost any laptop, into an ordinary digital TV and you'll be able to browse YouTube or access movie stores. The difference is, the new TV sets make the process easier and cheaper.
2008^  The latest tech darling has arrived, and it goes by the name of FriendFeed. Silicon Valley is buzzing about the seven-month-old startup, which offers a promising if somewhat messy new Internet service. Part of the interest comes from the blue-ribbon pedigrees of its founders, including Google alums Paul Buchheit and Bret Taylor, who honchoed Gmail and Google Maps. But just as much of the hullabaloo stems from how the founders are addressing a growing issue online: the balkanization of the Web. People are socializing on networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace and sharing pictures and videos on Web sites including Flickr and YouTube. But all these activities have been walled off from one another, like separate digital worlds. To keep track of friends and colleagues, you have to log in and out of different services constantly. FriendFeed is one of the first major efforts to break down these walls. With the startup's service, subscribers can pull together on one Web page everything their friends and colleagues are doing on more than 30 Web sites.
2009^"YouTube is ""definitely being more creative,"" said Nick Bomersbach, vice president of e-commerce for J.C. Penney Co. The retailer is making YouTube ""a much more important component of our marketing campaigns,"" he added, after a campaign it launched in July to promote its new clothing line from professional skateboarder Ryan Sheckler was more successful in directing traffic to the retailer's Web site than its previous YouTube campaigns."
2009^  For all its success selling text ads alongside search results, Google can't seem to make a go of it anywhere else in the ad world. In its hunt for new growth, the search giant is redoubling efforts to grab a bigger piece of the largest online ad market it doesn't control: display ads, the pictorial banners and videos that account for more than a third of the $40 billion online ad market. Google faces a tough challenge. Yahoo! and Microsoft's MSN have a huge lead in display ads, largely because they can put ads on their own pages of content, like Yahoo Finance and MSN Money. Google hopes to place more display ads on its YouTube site as well as on thousands of partner sites, from small blogs to The New York Times. Google will begin demonstrating what may be its most potent weapon in this emerging battle: an overhauled version of the advertising exchange that it picked up in the $3.2 billion acquisition of DoubleClick. The exchange is part of Google's overriding goal to make display ads, which can be expensive to create and complex to manage, so easy that even the smallest businesses can use them. Still, the exchange won't be an instant game-changer. Since exchanges require a new mindset at agencies and publishers, they may take time to catch on widely, says Mike Walrath, founder of Yahoo's Right Media exchange. And some think anything but search gets short shrift inside Google.
2009^  Hulu was launched in 2007. Each month the site's 1,700-title catalog of TV shows and movies attracts nearly 40 million viewers--people who will endure a couple of commercials per sitcom (vs. eight or more on TV) in exchange for the luxury of being able to watch a show for free, just one day after it airs on network TV. Those days may now be coming to an end. NBC, Fox, and ABC, the broadcasters that control Hulu, are warming to the idea of charging for at least some content. Hulu is expected to start testing subscription tiers for its programs in the new year, according to those who have worked with the Los Angeles company. The site may be No. 2 after YouTube in number of videos streamed, according to comScore, but analysts expect Hulu to lose $33 million this year. The betting among analysts is that sooner or later Hulu will ditch its open model in favor of a closed one.
2009^  Maximum Entertainment, a production company that makes video ads. Maximum's pitch, to marketers and ad agencies that might be interested in hiring it, revolves around the company's stable of directors, almost all of whom come from the world of film. The Internet continues to rework most long-held assumptions about media and marketing, but many advertisers, rightly or wrongly, still spend serious sums to ensure they get beautiful images. There are ego issues associated with hiring famous directors - all marketers think their products are stars - but the real dividends come from unusually memorable ads. Maximum's trump card is its knack for attracting well-known directors who are new to shooting ads. In its most idealized form, a company like Maximum solves two problems. It produces commercials for recession-battered advertising agencies that have cut back on in-house production. And it provides revenue to directors who make the sort of small movies that are cherished by the cognoscenti but rarely do boffo box office. The likes of Maximum represent one more way in which the decay of older business models spreads out monies, and opportunities, to new-style players.
2009^  On Feb. 3, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is going to make an honest man of me. Finally I will be able to buy a legal DVD of one of my favorite movies, Carol Reed's 1959 Our Man in Havana. But there's still no rhyme or reason to what films are available in any digital form. If, for example, you happen to have a videotape player around, you can watch an old VHS version of The African Queen. But you can't buy it on DVD or download it from any of the Hollywood-sanctioned online services. The basic problem is that Hollywood is attempting to preserve an analog business model in a digital age.
2009^  Thanks to the Web, companies have direct online access to consumers. Take that fact, stir in the surfeit of unemployed journalists (or fearful employed ones searching for safer perches), and you get novel kinds of businesses forming around news and media professionals. Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based company that sells anti-virus software, launched Threatpost.com on Mar. 11. The site, which focuses on computer and Internet security, aggregates articles and videos from across the Web. It employs two journalists to blog, edit the site, and produce its podcasts. Moving into media is an odd step given the wholesale carnage afflicting all sectors of that industry these days. But privately held Kaspersky is not after a media business. It's not selling ads on the site, though it may run promotions for business partners. Threatpost, says Kaspersky's chief marketing officer, Randy Drawas, is not a profit-generating enterprise. Rather, the company wants in on the public discourse concerning the issues its business revolves around. To sidestep concerns about favoritism, we draw the line at product news and reviews, says its editor Ryan Naraine, a tech journalist hired by Kaspersky in May 2008 as a public-relations staffer.
2009^"  The main backers of the long-awaited music site, Vevo, which was launched December 8th (Universal Music, Sony Music Entertainment, and EMI Group) hope Vevo will help turn around the sagging recording industry. For years record labels saw music videos as just another tool to sell CDs. Now, with album sales down more than 52% since their peak in 2000, the industry sees videos as a potential advertising gold mine--or at least a silver mine. Vevo's goal, says CEO Rio Caraeff, is to ""enhance"" music fans' experience by providing a central location for premium quality videos as well as bonus materials about the artists and their songs. Vevo, which has its own YouTube channel, is the music industry's version of Hulu, the TV and movie site operated by NBC, Fox, and ABC. Of course, Hulu isn't making money, though there are differences between the models. Some 20 advertisers signed on for Vevo's launch. Warner has a different approach. It believes Vevo's portal-like service diminishes the only brands that matter in music: the artists."
2009^"  The ""real-time Web"" is the term coined to describe the exploding number of live social activities online, from tweets to status updates on Facebook to the sharing of news, Web links, and videos on myriad other sites. It's also a whole new field of dreams for entrepreneurs and investors. Amid the downsized remains of Web 2.0, with online advertising and e-commerce in a drought, they're viewing the real-time Web as the Internet's Next Big Thing. The emerging sector is so new, and its boundaries so fuzzy, that it's difficult to know how much money has been sunk into how many firms. But many dozens of startups are staking claims and drawing interest from investors. ""Real-time"" is actually a bit of a misnomer. Most of this activity doesn't truly occur in real time, the way talking on the phone does, and social gestures such as sharing links with friends are just as important a part of the appeal as immediacy. These gestures--often accompanied by data from people's profiles on social networks, such as where they live or their age--hold the key to the real-time Web's moneymaking potential. Established search engines have no intention of falling behind."
2009^  The thing about Web video, of course, is that anyone can do it. Shoot it, edit it, distribute it on YouTube and other outlets--done. Assuming, of course, that distribute means put it alongside zillions of similar things. This is partly why building a Web video business is tough, as even showbiz vets have discovered. Unless you invert aspects of the traditional model, as a two-year-old Santa Monica (Calif.) Web video outfit called Deca does. Deca, an acronym for Digital Entertainment Corp. of America, is exploring several ways to produce Web series in unusually marketer-centric ways.
2009^  The two thirtyish founders of Web video production company EQAL, Miles Beckett and Greg Goodfried, are too media-savvy to boast they've cracked the code for minting big hits from serialized short online videos. Nevertheless, this is what their business (say equal) is based on, and it's why CBS is paying them to create a Web series offshoot of the network's upcoming mystery show Harper's Island. Goodfried and Beckett envision four ways for EQAL to make a buck: original online series that generate ad and sponsorship deals; doing work-for-hire for the likes of CBS; licensing its series abroad; and providing its tech platforms for videobloggers who've scored success on YouTube and want to start their own sites. Those ancillary streams are now important, Goodfried concedes, since selling ads and sponsorships around EQAL's original work just got tougher: What we do is the R&amp;D side of marketing, and everyone is cutting that in the short term.
2010^If the company is able to launch the service it is now pitching to broadcasters--tentatively dubbed Move TV--viewers could watch programs in one of three ways: via a computer's Web browser; on a television that is either equipped with a built-in Internet jack or connected to a set-top converter box; or on a wireless, Internet-connected device like an iPhone or iPad. Because Move isn't laying cable or launching satellites, the company's executives argue they can charge consumers far less than traditional pay-television operators for a comparable suite of channels.
2010^"On Friday, pay-cable channel Starz will premiere ""Pillars of the Earth,"" a $40 million, eight-part series based on the best-selling book by Ken Follett about the building of a gothic cathedral. Lush period dramas not only grab attention domestically, they help boost international sales because such stories are known around the world and aren't dependent on the latest American jokes or trends."
2010^"Peter Noble, 43 years old, a social worker in Washington D.C., watches several hours of online video a week, including Crackle Inc.'s action miniseries ""Urban Wolf,"" which he found through Google Inc.'s YouTube, and anime shows (Japanese slang for animated series) on Hulu. Revision3 Chief Executive Jim Louderback attributed the increase in prime-time viewing to the growing number of people watching the site's shows on their TVs through partnerships with hardware and software companies."
2010^The rise in prime-time viewing also underscores how consumers are opening up to a wider array of content during prime time, habits that will shape what they watch when they can get Internet and TV content on one device, said James McQuivey, an analyst at researcher Forrester Research. Chris Schembri, vice president of media services at AT&amp;T Inc., said the company started buying more Internet video advertising late last year as the caliber of content improved.
2010^"TiVo says its Slide Remote's keyboard is ""finger friendly"" and makes it easier to search for shows using its latest set-top boxes, which offer a database of upcoming TV listings and connect with online video services such as Netflix and YouTube."
2010^Vloggers have posted more than 5,100 videos showing them trying out Kinky-Curly products, and Ms. Davis says the attention has helped boost sales by 40% and push her seven-year-old company into profitability, as well as land its products in Target and Whole Foods Market.
2010^  Akamai Technologies is the leader in the booming business of helping Web sites stream content. Researcher comScore estimates that people watched 35.7 billion online videos in June in the US, up from 19.5 billion a year earlier. Akamai was the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year up to Jul 28, climbing 74%. That is when investors did a U-turn, sending Akamai down by 13% over two days. The causes of the drop are Moore's Law -- the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months, making computers cheaper and more powerful over time -- and competition. Paul Sagan, Akamai's CEO, says price wars do not mean commoditization. The most promising area of growth, Sagan says, may be high-definition video, which has just started arriving on PCs.
2010^  Amanda Dorsey, a 28-year-old unemployed writer and editor in Florida, is one of about 100,000 people in CrowdFlower's on-demand workforce who have taken pay in virtual rather than real dollars, says CEO Lukas Biewald, who also pays with the real stuff. Virtual cash can be used to buy seeds or weapons to play FarmVille, Mafia Wars, or other popular games on social media sites like Facebook. Players accumulate virtual money by earning points within a game or by converting real dollars into pretend currency. CrowdFlower pays to place help-wanted ads within such games as FarmVille, created by Zynga. People who answer the ads with companies that have online tasks to dole out are then placed by CrowdFlower, which gets compensated by those companies in real, green money. CrowdFlower pays on a per-task basis, at a rate set by the companies that hire it to find workers.
2010^  As a senior research scientist with Adobe Systems' Photoshop Group, Todor Georgiev is experimenting with plenoptic lenses. His plenoptic lens is actually an array of thousands of micro-lenses carved into a silicon wafer. With one shutter click, it captures thousands of variations -- different exposures or depths of field, for instance -- of the same image. Working with Andrew Lumsdaine, a computer scientist at Indiana University, he has built specialized software to interpret plenoptic photos and enable after-the-fact alterations. In an online video demonstrating the technology, Georgiev projects a picture of a field with a young girl in the foreground and beehives off in the distance. It is a stepping-stone on the way to Georgiev's goal of designing a camera that can capture all available optical data with a single click of the shutter.
2010^  Bob Iger, the CEO of Walt Disney, wants to acquire social games and other online services that come with established customers and talented creators - and can help sell Disney's famous brands. Since paying $350 million for the kids' social network Club Penguin, Disney has purchased Wideload Games, whose founder helped create Microsoft's hit Halo franchise. The entertainment giant acquired Tapulous, a publisher of music-related games for Apple's iPhone. On Jul 27, 2010, Disney made its biggest video game bet yet, agreeing to pay $563 million for privately held Playdom, the Mountain View, CA maker of Sorority Life and Mobsters, which are played on Facebook, MySpace, and mobile phones. If Playdom meets performance targets over time, its founders and investors may receive an additional $200 million. Iger says the buy-don't-build approach is what drove some earlier acquisitions.
2010^"  Cities and towns across the country, hungry for better broadband, are trying to grab Google's attention. The Mountain View company said last month it's planning a new Internet service of 1 gigabit per second, or about 20 times faster than the speediest offering from Verizon Communications. Richard Whitt, Google's Washington telecom and media counsel, says the company may spend ""hundreds of millions"" on the effort, which will involve stringing fiber-optic lines into homes in a small number of cities. If American Net service gets faster, people will likely spend more time watching videos or playing games online, providing Google fresh ways to expand its advertising business."
2010^  Earlier this summer the Web analytics company TubeMogul released a study estimating that the top indie video producers on YouTube earn north of $100,000 in annual advertising revenue alone. Although the video-sharing site may not be minting millionaire entertainers yet, six-figure incomes are within reach for the most industrious creators. So far in 2010, Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal, the 32-year-old comedians known professionally as Rhett &amp; Link, videos have averaged 119,457 views per day, according to TubeMogul. What really sets them apart -- lots of YouTube celebrities have more daily views -- is their leadership in doing branded integration, says David Burch of TubeMogul. By branded integration, Burch means sponsorships. For most, the YouTube partner program does not provide enough to survive on. So video makers hustle on multiple fronts: They sell T-shirts and mugs to fans on their YouTube pages. Musicians use videos to sell songs on iTunes and tickets for live gigs.
2010^  Ever since a mid-level engineer at Apple left a prototype iPhone in a Silicon Valley bar on April 18, the tech world has been consumed with the ensuing drama. Apple wouldn't comment for this story, and there's no way of knowing whether the prototype will ever get to market. Yet the device has generated excitement about mobile video communications. Expect a wave of new video-communication technology by Christmas. Skype, based in Luxembourg, plans to introduce a version of its online video-chat service for cell phones. Logitech general manager Eric Kintz says his company will introduce a cell-phone version of its Vid videoconferencing service by the end of the year. Meanwhile, an obstacle to consumer acceptance of earlier generations of videophones was the thought of being seen in a bathrobe or without makeup. And the current generation of Twittering, YouTube-ing over-sharers has fewer privacy concerns.
2010^  For more than a decade, a public-service television campaign from the UK's Transport Department has relied on cartoon hedgehogs to teach street safety to kids aged nine to 13, the group of pedestrians most likely to be killed or injured by autos. In 2007, the British government turned to Kati London, a producer at game-design studio Area/Code in New York City. For the UK, London and her team built a game called Code of Everand, which launched in 2009. Everand's 170,000 users play as Pathfinders navigating a dangerous fantasy world. The game is filled with subtle cues to encourage street safety. The government has commissioned an independent evaluation of the game's impact that is due in spring 2011.
2010^  Google has long been criticized for relying too heavily on one source of revenue, but it may soon have its first billion-dollar business outside of search advertising. Analysts predict revenues from the company's display advertising business will rise as much as 40% this year, to slightly more than $1 billion. Most of that business will come from selling video and banner ads on YouTube, which Google acquired in 2005.
2010^  It might be called the PlayBook, but the new tablet computer from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) is all about business. The device, introduced by co-CEO Mike Lazaridis in San Francisco on Sep 27, will go head-to-head with Apple's iPad. The PlayBook boasts several features the iPad lacks, including front- and rear-facing cameras for teleconferencing and the ability to play online videos made with Adobe's Flash technology. It is also smaller and lighter, and comes with the same security features that made the BlackBerry popular with governments and corporations. RIM has yet to announce prices and says the first version of the device will access the Web from a Wi-Fi hotspot or by wirelessly connecting through a BlackBerry via Bluetooth technology.
2010^  On June 30, 2010 the Homeland Security Dept.'s US Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement arm used a vacant sound stage at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, CA, to announce the seizure of nine Web sites with names like NinjaVideo.net and thepiratecity.org that allegedly traffic in illegal movie downloads. Hollywood may also get a big win in the pending financial reform legislation that will reshape the regulation of derivatives. Hollywood's biggest win so far has been on movie piracy. Major movie studios and the industry's lobbying group have been generous Democratic Party campaign contributors. Hollywood still has big policy priorities on its agenda. Major movie studios were disappointed by a federal court decision on June 24, 2010 that sided with Google in a lawsuit filed by Viacom alleging that Google's video-sharing Web site, YouTube, did not act quickly enough to take down copyright-infringing content.
2010^  On Sep 14, Twitter unveiled a redesign of its home page. The new look displays photos, videos, maps, and other extras in the stream of content. Users raved: A scan of Twitter updates about the redesign revealed mostly glowing comments about the new features. A whole ecosystem of companies has sprung up around the service, which allows its 145 million users to send 140-character messages, or tweets. Although the number of companies building third-party applications has grown large, the vast majority of them still generate little revenue. Twitter's recent moves have outside developers worried that a bigger, better Twitter will mean fewer opportunities for them. One reason for the worry among developers and investors is that Twitter does not do a good enough job of broadcasting its intentions. CEO Evan Williams says the redesigned home page will boost the number of Twitter users, which will be good for its partners.
2010^"  On the Internet, everyone can hear you scream - including your boss. When 25-year-old Brian Maupin posted a goofy cartoon to YouTube about an interaction between an imbecilic, iPhone-lusting customer and a salesman at an imaginary ""Phone Mart,"" he just wanted to make people laugh - and vent frustration from his job selling mobile gear at a Best Buy in Independence, Mo. Maupin posted the video on June 24, 2010. On July 2, 2010, Best Buy told Maupin that the videos disparaged the company and some products it sells. They asked him to take down the videos; he removed the two that mentioned Best Buy, leaving up the EVO-vs.-iPhone parodies. Maupin was suspended, and a store manager told him he would probably lose his job. Best Buy's negative reaction to a viral video created by an employee may help jump-start the cartoon maker's graphic arts career."
2010^"  The Logitech Revue, the new Google TV gadget, is a set-top box for those who do not mind stumbling over an occasional ""page not found"" message on their big-screen television or changing channels with a keyboard. The $299 Revue's remote control is a full-sized wireless keyboard. Google TV is a software that provides a single interface to the video universe and locates shows whether they originate with a cable or satellite provider, paid online services, or free sites. Besides the Revue, Google TV is built into a line of Sony TV models and one of its Blu-ray players. The idea behind Google TV is a good one. The problem is that the world of video is a wild and woolly place, and Google TV falls short of being able to tame it."
2010^  The new Apple TV has been shrunk to a quarter of its former size, the price has been slashed from $229 to $99, and, most important, it no longer includes a hard disk to store video. Apple TV is now built around its ability to use your home Wi-Fi network to stream high-definition movies and shows, photos, and music -- from online sources or your computer -- to your television. Apple TV's 720p-quality video provides a consistently crisp, smooth picture, with none of the stuttering that sometimes mars streamed content. The one blemish was that the device occasionally grossly overstated how long it would take to begin watching a movie after selecting it. Apple TV may turn out to be a Trojan Horse -- a deceptively simple gadget that, once in the home, expands its functionality until it takes control of everything.
2010^  Zynga's latest title, CityVille, is scheduled to begin its rollout at 6 P.M. Pacific on Nov 17. Privately held Zynga helped define online social games, the programs played by hundreds of millions of users with their friends on Facebook and other social networks. With social games on track to become a $2.2 billion industry by 2012, according to ThinkEquity analyst Atul Bagga, and contenders like Walt Disney and Electronic Arts buying their way into the business through acquisitions over the past year, the pressure is on to make CityVille the new addiction for online gamers. CityVille borrows heavily from SimCity, the classic urban simulation game. Users pave roads and lay railroad tracks to create virtual towns; residents are little computer-controlled characters that walk and drive to and fro. The goal is to increase the population of the town by building more and more sophisticated industries: Small shops become retail empires, villages become metropolises.
2011^"During the July filming for ""First Day,"" a comedy series for teenage girls, a woman with a spreadsheet and a red pen sat in a director's chair carefully checking off boxes. Web shows like ""First Day"" could provide a template for TV's future that harkens back to the era when advertisers not only sponsored but helped to create, cast and script ""soap operas"" and variety shows."
2011^ESPN said Thursday that it has made its flagship cable sports network available live on Apple Inc.'s mobile devices for subscribers to pay-TV service from Time Warner Cable Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and Bright House Networks.
2011^For the bloggers who use these sites, the exchange of copyrighted material and intellectual property--other people's photographs, music, lists of all the amazing things you ate for lunch--isn't just an aspect of the form, it's practically the entire business model. No, the Internet police probably aren't going to be kicking down your door to ask questions about that copyrighted photo of Ke$ha you just posted, but when it's almost as easy to do things the right way, why not at least try? It's a willful ignorance, says Bert Krages, a Portland, Ore., lawyer who specializes in intellectual property issues, and has written Legal Handbook for Photographers:
2011^"""[...] frankly, 'hundreds' making a living on YouTube isn't enough and in 2011 we know we can and should do more to help our partners grow,"" he wrote. Since launching in March 2007, New York-based Next New Networks has built a platform for developing, packaging and building audiences around original web video programming."
2011^Google has struck deals with media companies such as RTL Group, IAC and News Corp. as well as online-video creators to produce original content for YouTube in the hopes that people will want to watch the Web shows on their Internet-connected TVs, people familiar with the matter have said.
2011^"Google Inc. on Friday announced the creation of around 100 online video ""channels"" on its YouTube website that will have new original programming involving celebrities such as such as singer Madonna, rapper Jay-Z, actor Ashton Kutcher and former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal."
2011^Hardcore fantasy fans seeking to immerse themselves in their favorite fictional worlds are swapping tips on how to cook dishes like this grilled snake with fiery mustard sauce from the book 'A Feast for Crows.'
2011^Large Internet properties have been forging partnerships with media companies for years, seeking a steady supply of content to satisfy users' interests in topics as granular as local news and obscure health conditions.
2011^"Many brand advertisers were previously scared off by the large amount of user-generated, lower quality content on YouTube, said David Cohen, an executive vice president at Universal McCann, a media-buying agency owned by Interpublic Group of Cos. But in recent years, YouTube has accumulated higher-quality video and its new channels strategy ""is a clear signal of its commitment to creating immersive and engaging original content,"" he said."
2011^Michael Green, chief executive of The Collective, the management company that represents show creator Dane Boedigheimer, says items like hats, T-shirts and novelty items--he wants to develop a product as ubiquitous as the singing fish people mounted on their walls several yearsback--are in the works and will go on sale by year end.
2011^"Sam Schechner Technology and media companies are racing to create Internet-video hits closer to the scale of traditional TV, as consumers start to watch more video on Internet-connected televisions and tablet computers. Shows that have their first appearance--or ""window""--online also can help Internet companies vie for viewers with traditional video distributors, like cable and satellite companies."
2011^The initiative also is aimed at positioning YouTube for the rise of televisions and cable set-top boxes that let people watch online video in their living rooms YouTube won't abandon the way it has made money--namely, by identifying popular user-generated videos and offering to share ad revenue with the creators, people familiar with the matter have said.
2011^The number of U.S. households that pay for TV service from cable, satellite or phone companies dipped for the first time last year after decades of growth, with 335,000 fewer households paying for service between the first and the third quarters, according to research firm SNL Kagan.
2011^The upgrade is part of a broader YouTube overhaul that is in the works, as the video site attempts to broaden its focus from homemade videos to include professional entertainment content and position itself for the rise of Internet-connected televisions that allow people to easily watch online video in their living rooms.
2011^YouTube is still in the process of designing the channels and in recent weeks held meetings with Hollywood talent agencies such as Creative Artists Agency, William Morris Endeavor and International Creative Management to discuss the possibility of their clients creating YouTube channels, people familiar with the matter said. In addition to increasing the average time a YouTube user spends on the site, which stands at about 15 minutes a day, the moves are aimed at attracting new ad dollars, including a chunk from the $70 billion U.S. television-ad market, said people familiar with the matter.
2011^"YouTube proved a powerful catalyst for creativity; it gave the world Justin Bieber (but don't hold that against it!) but also improbable success stories like the Lonely Island, a comedy troupe of three guys in their 20s who parlayed making goofy homemade videos with their buddies into hit albums and gigs on ""Saturday Night Live"" (a show that has made television history by relying on the comic energy of several generations of ambitious 20-somethings)."
2011^YouTube, which is trying to become a next-generation video provider overseeing free online channels with professional-grade shows, is expected to give some content creators 55% of the resulting ad revenue after YouTube recoups the cash advances it paid them, some of the people said.
2011^  Deborah Lloyd, creative director of Kate Spade New York, has turned around Kate Spade by infusing it with her own quirky sensibility. A brand once best known for minimalist, angular handbags coveted by 40-year-old suburban moms today has a hipper take aimed at urban professionals between the ages of 26 and 36. Sales have doubled to $185 million since Lloyd arrived three years ago, helping make Kate Spade the best performer of Liz Claiborne's collection of brands. Lloyd and Craig Leavitt, the company's chief executive officer, devised a strategy that included bringing out more collections each year and expanding overseas, especially in China and Japan. Lloyd and Leavitt have boosted marketing to a younger crowd with the requisite Facebook page, Twitter feed, and YouTube videos.
2011^"  Even in the present era of 10,000 niches, mass customization, and the ""long tail"" -- of companies selling fewer items from a far vaster inventory -- people are, arguably, governed more than ever by what's popular. Thanks to the Internet's ability to rank everything, one can dwell almost exclusively in the world of trending Twitter topics, of top-reviewed restaurants, of Amazon.com bestselling books, of the cutest cute-cat YouTube videos. News sites all feature tallies of the Most Read, Most E-mailed, and Most Commented On articles -- creating a self-reinforcing conversation. This article presents the results of a survey on persons, products, or trends that experienced the greatest commercial growth or surge in popularity during 2010, or between last year and this one. The entries are plotted based on a relevant number along a scale beginning at zero and running to 14,594,874,110,347."
2011^  Founded in 2009, Kickstarter is an online fundraising platform for creative projects. Musicians, designers, filmmakers, and other artists craft a short pitch, usually a video, post it on the site, and set a fundraising target and a time frame. If the project meets its goal, Kickstarter, a for-profit company, takes a 5% cut and the creator gets the rest. Kickstarter has emerged as a legitimate option for financing independent films, where a six-figure project is on the low end. So far, the company has raised more than $21 million from nearly 240,000 backers for 2,443 films, according to co-founder Yancey Strickler. He says six films have crossed the $100,000 mark. Independence is one of Kickstarter's main advantages over the typical filmmaker fundraising road show.
2011^  In 2006, Adam Beguelin sold his startup, a video-search site called Truveo, to AOL for $50 million. Then he decided to pack up his family and move to Vietnam for a year of kite-surfing and cultural exploration. He is now back in the US and working on Sensr.net, a site that makes it easy to view, share, and store video feeds from network cameras, which connect to the Internet without need for a PC. Sensr monitors video from such cameras using any Internet-connected device. The site stores an unlimited amount of low-quality video and for a small monthly fee will start keeping high-definition feeds later this year. Beguelin says his service, which will also make it easy to share videos on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, is about socializing these devices.
2011^  Math was something Salman Khan understood. It was one of his majors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with computer science and electrical engineering. He is now a quasi-religious figure in a country desperate for a math Moses. His free Web site, dubbed the Khan Academy, may well be the most popular educational site in the world. He has posted more than 2,300 videos, beginning with simple addition and going all the way to subjects such as Green's theorem, normally found in a college calculus syllabus. His program has also spread from the homes of online learners to classrooms around the world, to the point that, in at least a few classrooms, it has supplanted textbooks. Khan is more than just popular. He is a darling of America's amateur educational elite who write checks and invite him to speak at their functions. Many of his followers are tech leaders, who understand more than most how dire America's standing in math education has become and what it may mean.
2011^  Online ads have been around since the dawn of the Web, but only in recent years have they become the rapturous life dream of Silicon Valley. Arriving on the heels of Facebook have been blockbusters such as the game maker Zynga and coupon peddler Groupon. Once again, 11 years after the dot-com-era peak of the Nasdaq, Silicon Valley is reaching the saturation point with business plans that hinge on crossed fingers as much as anything else. There's always someone out there crying bubble, it seems; the trick is figuring out when it's easy money -- and when it's a shell game. No one is suggesting that the top tier of ad-centric companies is going down should the bubble pop. As for the next tier or two down, where a profusion of startups is piling into every possible niche involving social networking and ads -- the fate of those companies is anybody's guess.
2011^  ReCaptcha still provides more than half of the 280 million captchas solved each day and has had to steadily ratchet up the difficulty. People have really seen the step-up in difficulty, says Tyler Paxton, a University of Michigan business school graduate and part of a recent wave of entrepreneurs who think they have a better alternative. The solution dreamt up by Paxton and his business school friends Reid Tatoris and Benjamin Blackmer: Mini-games. Their startup, aptly named Are You a Human, has created 10 simple games that, they say, are easy for humans to solve but almost impossible for computers. Are You a Human plans to make money by charging advertisers or Web sites to design games that integrate their brands, starting at about $25 per 1,000 games played.
2011^  This year, Canoe Ventures, the $150 million effort launched by Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Charter Communications, Cablevision Systems, and Bright House Networks, finished building a platform that allows advertisers to include interactive elements in commercials -- with Canoe collecting a fee for each ad campaign sold. There's just one problem: The Web got there first. Even if interactivity fails, Canoe has a back-up plan: video-on-demand. In the past 12 months, television viewers have streamed 8 billion videos on demand in the US, says researcher SNL Kagan. Each of these streams can be embedded with so-called dynamic advertising, commercials that can be updated and refreshed over time. Canoe CEO Kathy Timko, who acknowledges the cable companies that bankrolled Canoe want to see results, is hopeful the interactive spots now starting to run on cable networks AMC, E!, and Style Network will draw more advertisers to the technology.
2011^"  Using a palm-size MicroConsole adapter hooked up to the television and home network, a person can play ""in the cloud"" over the Internet, with the games actually running on powerful servers that might be 1,000 miles away. OnLive has the potential to be disruptive, maybe even revolutionary, technology. The $99 adapter plugs into a high-definition port in the television, and comes with a wireless handheld controller and one game. The system does not work over Wi-Fi, so a hardwired Internet connection is required. Hard-core gamers debate whether OnLive's response times are fast enough and whether graphics look as good as they do on a dedicated console. Because OnLive is a service and not just hardware, it offers some cool additional features."
2011^  Where's My Water?, the new mobile game from Walt Disney, stars Swampy, an alligator who lives in an underground sewer. Players swipe their fingers across an iPhone screen to guide water into his tub while dodging toxic sludge and collecting rubber duckies as prizes. With the 99 cents app, also available for the iPad, the House of Mickey is attempting to do something it has never done before: spin a multimillion-dollar franchise out of a character that made his debut on a 3.5-inch screen. Disney already has Swampy's career plotted out. A 12-episode animated series will air on Disney.com and on YouTube sometime in the first quarter of 2012, part of a recent deal that will have the two companies spend as much as $15 million on co-branded content.
2012^An Internet video seeking to draw attention to fugitive African rebel leader Joseph Kony now stands as the fastest-growing viral phenomenon in Web history, thanks to informal celebrity advocates and young viewers.
2012^At a time when digital-video outlets like Google Inc.'s YouTube are trying to make inroads in the ad market, the annual upfront marketplace has become a barometer of advertisers' appetite for television.
2012^Blue-chip advertisers that have bought ad inventory on the new channels include American Express Co., Unilever PLC, and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which spent an undisclosed amount to dominate the ad space on YouTube's new Spanish-language channels for 12 months.
2012^"Coming next to Netflix: ""House of Cards,"" a drama produced by David Fincher and starring Mr. Spacey as an ambitious politician, and a revival of the cult TV comedy ""Arrested Development."" Despite the influx of big-name talent, it's always hard to predict what will catch fire online--a homemade video of a precocious pet or amateur singer can command the kind of viewer numbers that network executives only dream of."
2012^Mr. Lin is one of a number of film and TV writers, directors, actors and producers who are venturing online to build YouTube channels with original scripted content in the form of short films and Web-size series.
2012^Ray William Johnson curses constantly, often gives his audience the finger and sometimes dresses up as a penguin, but he is attracting more than five million regular viewers to his twice weekly video commentaries, making him the biggest draw at Google Inc.'s online-video outlet. Mr. Johnson, who spikes his dark-brown hair two inches high, is the poster child for how some performers can harness the viral power of the Web to build a career, bypassing traditional media.

2012^The company also said it would do a better job of restricting copyright violators on the Web from participating in Google's advertising network, and that it would take steps to make it easier for users to find and access previews of copyrighted material, such as songs or videos, on the first Web-search results page, rather than having to click on links to other websites.
2012^[...]with TV, YouTube's fast production process and the lower costs of online video means producers can make near-instant changes to their programs in response to viewer feedback. [...]YouTube channel producers say the rapid evolution of their content will eventually allow them to find the best way to attract large audiences for the long term.
2012^  At less than $3, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia shares are worth a mere 8% of the $40 they hit after she took it public in 1999, serving orange juice and brioche to New York Stock Exchange traders. Rather than pack up her cookbooks and craft bags and head home to Connecticut or the Hamptons, America's most famous homemaker Martha Stewart is remaking her brand into one focused heavily on the Internet. On Sep 10, the company announced new partnerships to extend its content online, including a Martha Stewart Network with programs featuring Martha and chef Emeril Lagasse on video-streaming services Hulu and Hulu Plus, a deal to distribute shorter video clips on the AOL On Network, and a partnership with digital media company Fullscreen to rev up Martha's presence on YouTube.
2012^  Boxee, an Internet video provider, is embroiled in a spat with Comcast, News Corp, and Walt Disney, companies that own cable channels and are much more fluent in the language of Washington. The entertainment heavyweights are among those backing a rule the FCC proposed that would allow cable operators to encrypt all their television transmissions. That would be a blow to Boxee, which allows cable subscribers to plug their cords directly into Boxee Boxes -- bypassing the cable companies' own set-top boxes, and giving expensive dramas like Mad Men equal billing with YouTube's dog-on-skateboard videos. Taking a page from the Internet industry's recent defeat of the media industry-backed Stop Online Piracy Act, Boxee has rallied some of its two million users through blogs and social networks, asking them to voice their opposition to the FCC rule.
2012^  Consumers have plenty of ways to watch movies over the Internet. There's Netflix, Amazon.com Instant Video, Wal-Mart Stores' Vudu, and Apple's iTunes. Now the market for buying and renting films online is about to get more crowded. A new service, Redbox Instant by Verizon, plans to throw open its virtual doors to customers willing to pay $8 a month. Subscribers will gain online access to a catalog of older films at no extra fee, an on-demand store of newer movies available for rent or purchase, and DVD rental credits good for four recent releases each month from Redbox's kiosks at supermarkets and drugstores around the US. So far, studios seem to like the approach.
2012^"  David Cohen, executive vice president at advertising agency UM, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., said the move by Everyday Health is a ""testament to both the YouTube channel initiative and an acknowledgment that as the media world continues to fracture, the best programs have anchors in multiple media channels,"" meaning both online and in broadcast."
2012^  Google has long dominated online advertising in much of the world by placing ads next to search results, and it was expected to do the same in China. But since the company's 2010 decision to stop self-censoring Web content on the mainland and move its China servers to Hong Kong, Google's business has fallen further behind Baidu, the local search champ. Now, with the help of a recent acquisition, Google has managed to carve out a market niche where it's the mainland leader: ads aimed at mobile phones. Mobile-search advertising goes beyond generating ads related to searches and automatically sends ads to users playing games, viewing videos, or using other apps on their smartphones and tablet computers.
2012^  If Google is essential to navigating the Web, Getty Images has become essential to visualizing it. Cobbled together through acquisitions, Getty is the world's largest photo and video agency, and its database of 80 million images is the raw material from which many of the Web's slide shows and photo galleries are made. A search for its images of happy people, for instance, turns up 626,317 results. That depth allows Getty to license its image trove online to all manner of bloggers and Web sites, businesses small and large, advertisers, newspapers, and magazines. With annual revenue approaching $1 billion, according to Getty, it's become a media business too important to ignore. Carlyle Group certainly took notice: On Aug 15, the private equity firm agreed to buy majority ownership of Getty from another private equity investor, Hellman &amp; Friedman, in a deal that values the company at $3.3 billion.
2012^  In a city with no shortage of studios, YouTube Space is a new hybrid: a slick production facility intended as a talent incubator, where selected YouTube creators will be granted free access to complete projects, hone skills and collaborate with peers in a campus setting.
2012^  In an interview, Dick Glover, CEO of FunnyOrDie.com, talked about his strategy for the humor on the site. Glover believes in a model of: keep the cost of content and marketing low, keep the quality high. You can be very successful. By and large, for short-form videos, the celebrity talent are compensated in a number of ways but not a cash remuneration: complete creative freedom, great promotional vehicle for whatever else they may be doing. By marketing on a media system that exists online, there are ways to reach people on a daily basis that isn't like having to spend $1 million on an ad on Thursday-night television. The greatest challenge has always been, and will always continue to be, to be funny every day, everywhere, again and again.
2012^  In an interview, Hulu CEO Jason Kilar talks about the future of online video. Kilar says the Internet is going to have a bigger impact on content creators than the television ever had. He adds that the reason why that's the case is that suddenly people are able to tell stories 24/7 in the home, out of the home, in every room of the home. Kilar also says that the pay television industry today is a very healthy business. People pay for Netflix, HBO, VUDU, and Hulu Plus. He adds that the only thing that differentiates all those services is what people get in return for a given price. Meanwhile, Kilar says that Hulu launched its first original scripted series, called Battleground. He adds that they thought it was a story that needed to be told, and it would be a great differentiation for a service like Hulu.
2012^  It's all the rage to predict the demise of online display ads and Yahoo!, the company that pioneered the business. Display advertising is the old man of online marketing -- Web site banners are much less fashionable than, say, a personalized coupon delivered to your smartphone. The issue isn't the viability of display ads but whether Yahoo can stay in the game. From 2009 to 2011, the company's share of the market fell from 15.4% to 10.8%, according to EMarketer. The drop was largely due to the growth of Facebook and Google's YouTube. Yahoo is chasing buyers in online video, the fastest-growing category of Web ads, says EMarketer, which estimates the format will grow by 38% annually through 2015.
2012^  It wasn't so long ago that the notion of kids having their own tablet computers seemed excessive. But as tablets flood the market in record numbers -- more than 27 million were purchased in the third quarter alone, according to market researcher IDC -- it's become clear that the entertainment-laden devices are tailor-made for smaller hands. That's why in December the online retailer started positioning its hot-selling tablet as a makeshift toy. Amazon introduced FreeTime Unlimited, a subscription multimedia service for the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD aimed exclusively at children between the ages of three and eight. Amazon is heavily promoting the service's parental controls, which allow adults to limit the time each child can spend watching videos and restricts purchases kids can make while online. While the digital media landscape has been perilous for paid subscription services, there's evidence that FreeTime Unlimited could succeed where others failed because it's built on unfettered access to a bottomless well of content.
2012^"  Kids have been daring each other to do stupid stuff since the beginning of time, but only recently have social media come along to enhance -- and help share -- the experience. A recent craze sweeping teen circles is the Cinnamon Challenge. The goal is to gobble up a teaspoon of cinnamon and swallow it all in 60 seconds. The fun part comes from capturing it all on a laptop or phone and putting it on YouTube or Facebook, where friends and strangers can watch and revel in your pain. Where content is free, an entrepreneur is usually trying to make money off of it, and that person has emerged in the form of Scott Rosenbaum, who is seeking to monetize the orange ""dragon breath,"" as he calls it, often emitted by challengers. Rosenbaum is the proprietor of Cinnamonchallenge.com."
2012^  Last year, marketers spent about $60 billion on television advertising in the U.S., dwarfing the $2 billion spent for online video advertising, according to eMarketer Inc. Many media executives believe a shift is inevitable as the amount of time Americans spend viewing online video has increased, while time spent on watching programs on traditional TV sets has declined.
2012^"  Late last year, Google's YouTube announced it would spend $100 million to support video programming. YouTube is funding filmmakers, artists, writers, and proven online hitmakers with grants that range from a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars. It will eventually have about 100 new channels, including the Chopra Well, which will feature 10 spirituality-themed shows. By building a library of professionally produced programming that is closer to Charlie's Angels than to ""Charlie Bit My Finger,"" Google hopes to attract more viewers, reduce the need to negotiate with Hollywood studios, and woo some of the big-name advertisers who have been reluctant to put their products next to cat videos. YouTube is betting there's an entire class of material that might languish on cable but will find an audience on the Web. Others in the online ad world aren't so sure big brands can get comfortable with this kind of consumer control, despite YouTube's push into premium programming."
2012^  Los Angeles startup Therapick.com is shooting video interviews with licensed psychotherapists and compiling an online directory of short profile clips. People can use the site to look up psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, and clinical social workers by Zip Code and specialty, then watch their videos before deciding whether to schedule a session. So far, Therapick has taped interviews with more than 500 therapists in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and seven other cities. Therapists pay $299 a year to put the videos on Therapick's site, accompanied by text descriptions of their backgrounds and specialties. They can also embed the spots on their own Web sites or put them on YouTube.
2012^  Michael Carter's company, Game Closure, builds tools that let game developers write one version of their genius idea, then publish it anywhere. At its core, HTML 5 is a set of standards that lets Web browsers understand animations, videos, graphics, and other multimedia content without the need to download a plug-in like Adobe's Flash, which is how most Web videos and graphics are displayed today. The goal of HTML 5, which is gradually making its way into all modern browsers, including ones on mobile devices, is to make sites look and feel just like apps downloaded directly to a phone or desktop. Some worry the rush to HTML 5 could lead to shoddier software. Since the very idea behind HTML 5 is universality, it may discourage developers from tailoring their code to the capabilities of specific devices.
2012^  Not long ago, like many YouTube entertainers, the comedians Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal juggled lots of duties. They were part of the elite group of performers who could generate six-figure annual incomes via YouTube's revenue-sharing program, and by selling merchandise and creating sponsored video ads for consumer brands. Now Rhett &amp; Link have joined a growing crew of indie YouTube stars who have signed on to be represented by the Collective, a newfangled media company based in Los Angeles. The company aims to capitalize on the shifting entertainment landscape, in part, says entertainment veteran Michael Green, by teaming with artists like Rhett &amp; Link, who he believes are well positioned to capitalize on the decentralization of media consumption. Brand spending in digital video has ballooned, growing from $324 million in 2007 to $1.8 billion in 2011, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. The Collective's artists have benefited.
2012^"  On Monday afternoon, visitors to ABCNews.com who wanted to learn more about the latest news on the tragedy in Newtown, CT, had a range of Web video options to choose among. But before they could watch, say, ""Newtown Shooting: Teachers and Parents Turn to School Security,"" visitors had to first sit through a playful ad for skin-care products. This represents a tricky and growing challenge for news organizations. According to EMarketer, online video is the fastest growing category of Web ads; spending is expected to skyrocket from $2.93 billion in 2012 to $8.04 billion in 2016. When disaster strikes, be it a mass shooting, a terrorist attack, or a deadly storm, broadcasters attempt to strike a balance between making money from the surge in online viewers and managing advertisers' reluctance to be seen alongside tragic news."
2012^"  On the morning of Oct 18, 2012, shortly after publishing a Newsweek cover story entitled, ""Heaven Is Real,"" editor-in-chief Tina Brown informed her staff that the magazine itself would soon be joining the afterlife. In a challenging environment for print advertising, Brown explained, she and executives at Barry Diller's IAC had decided to instead publish Newsweek Global, a digital-only magazine supported by subscriptions and targeting a highly mobile, opinion-leading audience that consumes news on tablets, e-readers, and smartphones. However, industry analysts say going digital, while a reliable approach for rapidly cutting costs, remains an uncertain path to revitalization. Newsweek Global, which will launch in early 2013, will have to compete for ad dollars not only with the digital operations of its print adversaries, such as Time, but also with a new breed of search engine and social media news outlets such as BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post; robust indie blog networks such as Gawker Media; and video-savvy general news sites such as CNN.com."
2012^  Penny Arcade, which publishes online comics and puts on related events, is trying to use Kickstarter, the popular crowdfunding platform, with an ambitious campaign aimed at replacing the revenue it currently gets from advertising with funding from fans. Penny Arcade began as a simple video-game-oriented Web comic that writer Jerry Holkins and artist Mike Krahulik posted semi-regularly online in the late 1990s, and it has become a regular series with a number of associated real-world products and its own gaming conference called PAX. In its description of the Kickstarter campaign and related blog post, Holkins said eventually he and Krahulik wondered whether the platform would allow them to raise enough money to go back to a fully reader-funded mode.
2012^  Roku's media streamer has become a go-to device for small online video services that target expats all over the world. The first live-television feeds on Roku were foreign-broadcast transmissions, and numerous companies have used Roku exclusively to reach expat audiences within the US. But for many developers, all this came to a halt when Roku removed 25 channels with foreign-language content, effectively shutting down the entire international section of its channel store. The reason for this move is that Roku struck a distribution agreement with Dish Network in May, which makes the satellite provider's DishWorld service the exclusive distributor of foreign programming on the platform. Customers can use DishWorld to subscribe to packages of content from such countries as India and Brazil, with streams delivered directly to their Roku boxes -- no satellite subscription required.
2012^"  The Department of Justice begins an antitrust probe into whether Comcast, Time Warner, and other cable providers are now trying to manipulate the way customers use the Internet -- specifically, whether imposing caps on the amount of data people can download monthly discourages them from using Netflix, Hulu, and other rival online video sites and steers them to the cable companies' own video-on-demand services, which aren't subject to the caps. Comcast and other Internet providers want customers to accept that they are the proprietors of separate, special Internets. It can be seen in the way they've tried to rebrand the Web as a private product. Comcast refers to its Web access as ""Xfinity."" AT&amp;T calls it ""U-Verse."" Verizon doesn't sell Web access, either. It sells ""FiOS."""
2012^"  The jailed Russian punk rock group Pussy Riot did not gain international fame through their musicality per se. That insight appears in an academic paper by three electronic-commerce researchers from the University of Texas, Austin. The 45-page paper, filled with equations and Greek letters, explains how being deliberately offensive can help a video break through the clutter on YouTube, where 72 hours' worth of video are uploaded every minute. The paper explains the two reasons people click on a video that lots of other people have clicked on. One is ""social learning""; the fact that others have watched it tells you it must be good. A very different reason is ""network effect""; whether the video is good or not, it becomes more valuable to watch it if others are watching it."
2012^"  The term ""Internet memes"" is derived from genetics, describing the evolution of ideas and cultural phenomena by natural selection. These days, meme is the catchall for freely copied and altered tidbits of amusing online content, from animations and photo captions to viral videos that inspire a flood of parodies. Within weeks, most fade to oblivion, but those with endurance make the leap to the commercial world. Properly exploited, some memes can bring in anywhere from a few thousand dollars for a single licensed broadcast of a popular video to six figures for an integrated marketing campaign based around a meme. In the past two years, Lashes has helped clients license memes to brands such as Nike, Nokia, Wonderful Pistachios, and Lipton Brisk Iced Tea, which uses the Scumbag Steve photo in a new Web ad. Memes are a tremendous asset for brands because, like celebrities, they have an audience that recognizes and appreciates them."
2012^  While touring with his rock band Fiction Plane in 2010, bass player and vocalist Joe Sumner woke up one morning to discover 450 videos on YouTube of the previous night's show in Lithuania. Uploaded by fans with mobile phones, the footage was mostly grainy, shot from awkward angles, and had horrible sound. But it gave Sumner an idea of linking all of these videos and make a compelling movie. Vyclone, a company Sumner founded two years ago with friend David King Lassman, attempts to realize this vision. Its free program debuted in Apple's App Store on Jul 18 and lets two or more people in close proximity shoot video with their iPhones, upload the clips, and view a movie automatically spliced together from different angles.
2012^  With all the hoopla surrounding YouTube's new channels and ad initiative, business owners may be left wondering how to raise their profile on the site. One small company that has made a pretty big splash is Pigtronix, a guitar effects-pedal maker headquartered in Port Jefferson, NY, a town on Long Island about 60 miles east of Manhattan's Upper West Side, where YouTube unveiled scores of new channels to ad executives on Wednesday evening. YouTube is a core part of its marketing strategy, Pigtronix co-founder Dave Koltai told as he demonstrated his pedals on Tuesday afternoon. Over the years the company's video strategy has morphed, Koltai says. While he initially thought product demos would be the way to go he has since realized that music will get people coming back, especially if it's a big name who's doing the playing.
2013^  A chapter in a soon-to-be-published book on the digital economy by the National Bureau of Economic Research makes a compelling case for media companies speeding up efforts to get as much of their content online as possible. The study looks at what happened in 2009, when ABC added a chunk of television shows to Hulu, the popular streaming-video service. The results were immediate and striking: Illegal downloads of those shows dropped almost 20% compared with a control group. Content companies are coming up with more legal ways to find media online, and at the same time file sharing is dropping off. A recent analysis of overall Internet activity by Sandvine showed that file sharing as a whole has dropped from 31% of traffic in 2008 to less than 10% today.
2013^  A few weeks ago, a two-and-a-half minute video called Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise circulated online. The coffee shop was a real coffee shop -- 'sNice in Manhattan's West Village -- and the looks of horror on customers' faces were genuine. The prank was funny and fascinating, and has since been watched more than 46 million times on YouTube and discussed on both Good Morning America and CNN. It's also, technically speaking, a commercial. The prank and resulting video were a promotional stunt for Sony Pictures' Carrie remake; this becomes evident when the movie's title and release date appear at the end. The need to be shared and go viral is the new orthodoxy of online media. But it's also something that's incredibly difficult to engineer. There is, of course, one problem with using unsuspecting bystanders' genuine emotional reactions to sell your product: Sometimes they don't like it.
2013^  Among Christopher Widauer's duties as technical director of the Vienna State Opera is to make sure spectators in his 2,100 seats can clearly see the stage as well as translations of the libretto. He had to consider a much bigger audience when his bosses said they wanted to earn additional revenue with Web and mobile HD simulcasts -- without the delays and hiccups that often interrupt online videos. The opera house is one of more than 600 clients that have relied on software maker Ooyala to help them set up and manage streaming video services. Mountain View (CA)-based Ooyala is one of a handful of companies that provide such back-end services, selling subscription-based software that helps automate online video programming and ad delivery.
2013^"  Apparently unsatisfied with acquiring countless tech startups, Yahoo has gone out and acquired David Pogue. The erstwhile New York Times tech columnist announced the move via Tumblr, appropriately enough, on an account that he apparently started over the weekend. Pogue will be helping Yahoo build a consumer-tech site, which will include online columns, goofy videos, and mysterious ""real-world creations."" The move seems to make sense for him. He has benefited immensely from his relationship with the Times and has used it to build a pretty good name for himself. The hiring fits into what Yahoo has been trying to do, too. The plan seems to be to come up with as many ways to drive traffic as possible and figure out how to make money later."
2013^  Arnold Donald had been on the board of Carnival for 12 years when he got a call in June from the cruise company's lead director, Stuart Subotnick. It was an offer to succeed Micky Arison as Carnival's CEO, and Donald was incredulous. Donald's skepticism was understandable. Arison, the son of Carnival's founder, had run the company for 34 years; Donald, a former Monsanto executive, had no prior cruise-operating experience. Carnival -- the world's largest cruise company with 10 brands ranging from the low-cost Carnival to the pricey 173-year-old British Cunard Line -- had been in crisis since its Costa Concordia ran aground off the Italian coast in 2012, killing 32 people. That was followed by more incidents this year, including a fire aboard the Carnival Triumph in February that further tarnished the company's image with extensive news video of passengers stranded at sea. Among Donald's first steps were meetings with travel agents to repair relations frayed in recent years as the company put more emphasis on automated online bookings.
2013^  Before its video went live on YouTube, almost nobody had heard of Coin. In the one-minute, 45-second ad, a schlubby, bearded guy demonstrates how to use the credit card-size device to electronically store up to eight cards that can be used to pay at a checkout counter and a restaurant. Posted on Nov 14, the ad has close to seven million views. Coin reached its first-month sales goal of $50,000 less than an hour after it went up for preorders online. CEO Kanishk Parashar says that's due in large part to the ad, which helped attract greater interest from consumers and contract manufacturers. Adam Lisagor made the ad. A former journeyman film editor and the founder of Sandwich Video, he has emerged as the director of choice among Silicon Valley startups looking to gain visibility. In 2010, when he started making the videos, there were only a few filmmakers specializing in the app-demo business.
2013^  Consumers have plenty of ways to watch movies over the Internet. There's Netflix, Amazon.com Instant Video, Wal-Mart Stores' Vudu, and Apple's iTunes. Now the market for buying and renting films online is about to get more crowded. A new service, Redbox Instant by Verizon, plans to throw open its virtual doors to customers willing to pay $8 a month. Subscribers will gain online access to a catalog of older films at no extra fee, an on-demand store of newer movies available for rent or purchase, and DVD rental credits good for four recent releases each month from Redbox's kiosks at supermarkets and drugstores around the US. So far, studios seem to like the approach.
2013^  For some truly strange advertisements, look no further than the National Cable &amp; Television Association's Hole Saga, a Web site consisting of several pro-cable video sketches. The videos, which have been running for just over a week, discuss the hole in people's hearts that is formed by an absence of cable. The concept is strange in that it's based on people having a loving relationship with a cable provider. People should probably give cable a break. It's not the best time to be running a pay television company. Cable companies lost 687,000 subscribers in the last quarter. Many of those people moved to satellite television or fiber optic options offered by telecoms, meaning that the industry lost 113,000 subscribers over that period, according to analyst Craig Moffett.
2013^"  Fresh off the launch of its new Kevin Spacey political drama, House of Cards, Netflix is planning an original animated children's series. Turbo: F.A.S.T. (Fast Action Stunt Team) is a spin-off from the DreamWorks Animation studio film Turbo, which is set for release July 19. For Netflix, which recently bolstered its kid-friendly offerings by signing an exclusivity deal with Walt Disney, the Turbo series will be its first ""in-house"" production aimed at children. Netflix's push to increase its original programming is an effort to distinguish the company from other online video services, such as Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, which often carry the same older television shows and movies as Netflix does. Netflix also licensed rights to stream Disney's older content as part of the transaction."
2013^  German car maker Audi posted three versions of its ad on YouTube and let consumers select which ending should air, while Ford Motor's Lincoln brand started a Twitter campaign that asked people to tweet their most memorable road-trip stories.
2013^  In a bid to attract more advertising dollars and shift advertiser budgets away from TV, YouTube over the next few years could end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars in cash advances to video producers around the world to create high-quality, original content for YouTube.
2013^  In an interview, Tom Freston, the former head of Viacom, talked about breakfast with Oprah Winfrey, Afghan TV, and the killer media app. On what's it like to move between Winfrey and Shane Smith, Freston said Smith has an interesting bunch of guys. And Winfrey is wonderful. She romanced me into helping her. She made breakfast for me. What alliances he sees coming, Freston said the next wave is going to be online video. With all the extra screens -- the iPads and the iPhones -- and the social tools, soon the killer application is going to come along for navigation, which will make this all seamless.
2013^"  In any estimate of the world's bestselling authors, there is William Shakespeare, Agatha Christie, and everyone else. With at least five titles that topped the New York Times bestseller list, Tom Clancy is one of the bigger names in the ""everyone else"" category. Today, literary franchises can hit Clancy-type sales numbers in a few hours, but books were just a part of the Clancy universe. There were also the feature films stocked with A-list actors -- four in all: The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, and The Sum of All Fears. In total, the films grossed $616 million at theatres, according to Box Office Mojo. Clancy's name also powered up a video-game company, Red Storm Entertainment, which had a string of hits, including Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon."
2013^  In a report this week, the Superior Audiovisual Council (CSA) says that video-sharing Web sites should be subject to a tax that helps finance the production of French films and television shows. The so-called culture tax, totaling more than E1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) annually, is paid by movie theaters, broadcasters, and Internet service providers in France. The CSA contends that YouTube, French video-sharing site DailyMotion, and their ilk are effectively providing video-on-demand services, which are already subject to the tax. Although the CSA report says that videos posted online by private individuals should not be subject to taxation, it contends that video-sharing sites increasingly have become professional content providers.
2013^  In March 5 a 16-year-old Texan named Austin Mahone posted a video to YouTube in which he and some buddies dance to Harlem Shake, an electronic single turned viral phenomenon. The song, by the Brooklyn producer Baauer, came out as a free download last spring. The Harlem Shake is not simply the latest fad to take up temporary residence in our hips. The craze highlights permanent changes in how the music industry works and looks. Since YouTube's inception in 2005, the site's been known primarily as a bottomless Big Gulp brimming with Webcam confessionals, cute-mammal footage, and assorted other Web junk. The best-known YouTube alum is Justin Bieber, once a wee Canadian nobody who began showcasing his angelic whinny on the site in 2007. On a smaller scale, the future may look something like another Mad Decent artist, the eccentric rapper RiffRaff who's built a thriving career by flooding YouTube with cheap videos for songs he cranks out at a feverish pace.
2013^  It's been nearly eight years since Microsoft performed a major overhaul of its Xbox video game console. In that time, the Xbox has demonstrated remarkable resilience, thriving amid huge shifts in the types of devices and online services people like to use. It may be Microsoft's only beloved consumer product, in part because the company hasn't mucked up its winning formula. With the gaming market shifting away from consoles, though, Microsoft is doing a little tinkering. The goal is to move its system decisively beyond gaming and transform the Xbox into an entertainment hub for users' televisions. They turn a television that's delivered to you one-way through a straw into a two-way experience that understands what's going on with you, says Xbox division head Don Mattrick. Microsoft's bid to manage more home entertainment includes customizing the new Xbox to keep each family member happy.
2013^  Measured by bytes, the two sites Netflix and YouTube now make up more than half of Internet traffic in the US, according to Sandvine's latest Global Internet Phenomena Report using data from September. This year the duo crossed the halfway point, hitting 50.3%. Notably lagging are two other widely discussed video services: Hulu and Amazon (AMZN). Both companies are slipping from their already lowly traffic numbers: Amazon accounted for 1.6% of total downstream traffic in September, compared with an average of 1.75% in the second half of 2012. This mammoth disparity is a way to set the stage for what should be a big week for Amazon's video streaming service, which is releasing its first original television series.
2013^"  Michael Hayes, president of digital at ad agency Initiative, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos, said there is ""downward pressure on advertiser rates due to the sheer volume of options that advertisers have"" through YouTube's rivals."
2013^  More than 100 employees of Bigcommerce, a four-year-old company, are on their feet or perched on swings in its huge game room, with plate-glass views out over Hill Country. Executive Steve Case, overdressed from a meeting earlier in the day at the US Capitol, is in a button-down shirt, pleated slacks, and tasseled loafers, looking a generation older than the scruffy dot-com workers he's about to address. For any startup, a new round of funding is an ecstatic occasion. Getting the money from Case -- billionaire co-founder of America Online, father of the consumer Internet -- brings a sense of destiny: Maybe this company will become legendary, too. In 1983, Case was a 24-year-old marketer for Pizza Hut when his older brother, an investment banker, helped him get a job at a small company that was trying to make video games interactive. That venture failed, but another one sprouted up.
2013^  One of the business lessons Dave Howe has learned during his time as president of the Syfy cable network: Six-foot-tall extraterrestrials are a lot less expensive than 12-foot-tall ones. That knowledge came in handy during production of Defiance, Syfy's new series about aliens who come to earth and their prickly relationship with the current inhabitants. Defiance is being simultaneously produced as a video game; the developers at Trion Worlds, Syfy's gaming partner, wanted some of the alien characters to be 12 feet tall. Defiance is perhaps the most ambitious transmedia project yet: A television show and massively multiplayer online video game where plot elements from the weekly show bleed into the real-time cyberworld of the game. The series debuted on April 15 to an audience of 2.7 million, making it the most successful launch in seven years for Syfy, which is owned by NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast.
2013^  Online advertising firm Thinkmodo makes videos for companies such as Oakley, AMC Networks, and CBS Films, and almost every one has been watched more than a million times -- many of them more than 10 million. Thinkmodo's last ad was a two-and-a-half-minute promo for Sony Pictures Entertainment's Carrie remake that featured a woman using her telekinetic powers to freak out coffee shop patrons. Released in October, it's been viewed more than 52 million times on YouTube; Google recently ranked it the second-most-watched online ad of the year. The company's videos follow a specific formula. First, co-founder Michael Krivicka says, you have to play on people's emotions. Don't show the product or advertise the film too blatantly, or people will stop watching. When filming a prank, make it as authentic as possible while guarding against lawsuits.
2013^  On March 13 Netflix introduced a revamped integration with Facebook, showing its 33 million online members on the Netflix home page which movies and television episodes their Facebook friends have watched. Users can also post to Facebook individual videos they've loved or hated and discuss them on their timelines. Sharing video rental data is Netflix CEO Reed Hastings's latest effort to change how people watch movies and television. Unlike HBO and the broadcast networks, Netflix lets viewers watch as many episodes as they wish on their own schedule. Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes has criticized the strategy, saying Hastings makes it easy for people to drop the service after they've quickly seen what they like. Netflix is betting its new social features will get subscribers to stick around and remain part of the online conversation.
2013^"  Other mainstream-media companies have launched channels for YouTube, while also putting their cable network programming online, available for pay TV subscribers, a strategy called ""TV Everywhere."""
2013^  Raghu Venkat was at his breaking point in 2010. After he spent months helping to fine-tune the analytics software behind Aster Data Systems, his bosses ordered him to take a two-week vacation and handed him a $1,500 prepaid debit card as a bonus for his hard work. He spent the money on a massive widescreen television and a couple of video game systems, making his apartment the new home base for co-workers Manav Mital and Hariharan Kolam. Soon, Venkat was obsessed with games like Bioshock. Out of the desire for speedier gaming and online services came the idea for Instart Logic, the Mountain View (CA)-based company the trio quit their jobs to found. Instart's software determines what users tend to look for on a given Web site and breaks desired Web pages into prioritized chunks.
2013^"  Scott Schreer is an indie musician, but not the garage-band variety. The composer licenses his 1,700 musical works, designed as scenic background music, to film and television producers. Less gratifyingly, he can also hear them used, without permission, in thousands of videos on YouTube. Hunting those stray recordings and trying to collect licensing fees from the video-sharing Google subsidiary didn't seem worth the trouble. Then Schreer started using Audiam. Audiam's program combs YouTube for videos that feature unlicensed music, using audio-matching software and YouTube's own Content ID system. Founder Jeff Price, a friend of Schreer's, pitches musicians like this: ""Let's go find you money that already exists. It's buried treasure."""
2013^  Separately, Google's YouTube video website is trying to obtain licenses from music labels to start a paid subscription service for music videos and potentially also for audio-only songs, these people said.
2013^  Television has been the last stand of traditional media, but the time has come for it to defend its turf. After flirting with video advertising for much of the year, Facebook said Tuesday that it will begin to put promoted videos into its news feed. Facebook users will roll their eyes and post status updates about being annoyed. But success for the video ads could genuinely threaten television companies. The markets for advertising in other types of traditional media have been decimated by the Internet. But while television ad sales dipped when the recession hit, they soon recovered and have continued to climb. This is primarily because television remains the last true mass-market medium, according to Paul Sweeney of Bloomberg Industries. Piecing together an audience by buying various types of advertising is simply less efficient than slapping an ad on television.
2013^"  The major YouTube stars were ushered behind back staircases and accompanied by walkie-talkie toting assistants who told teenage girls ""no pictures."" [...]the preponderance of attendees were casual users like Owen and Elliott Desai, 17-year-old identical twin brothers from Minnesota breaking into their first VidCon with 250 business cards printed with their senior picture on it."
2013^  The move would add a new revenue stream for YouTube and its thousands of content partners, and it could potentially help the site lure new video creators who want a subscription model rather than rely only on advertising, these people said.
2013^  The National Football League (NFL) has $6 billion worth of annual incentives to keep Americans from watching games online. So fiercely does the league guard its lucrative television deals that to watch football online in the US, fans still have to pay a television provider: The only Americans who are technically allowed to watch NFL's live streams are those customers who purchase DirecTV's all-access Sunday Ticket package, a deal worth $1 billion to the NFL. For just a couple of dollars cord-cutting fans could digitally pretend to be from somewhere overseas, which would give you access to every single NFL game, live and in high definition, through your Internet connection. That's the promise of Canadian startup Adfreetime.com, one of a handful of providers to offer what's called a DNS-switching service. Adfreetime and such rivals as Unblock-us.com, which charges $4.99 per month for a similar region-switching service, have made it easy and remarkably cheap to get access to all kinds of streaming video.
2013^"  The revamped Yahoo.com, which goes live on Wednesday morning, represents Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer's boldest attempt yet to remake and update the Web giant she took over last July. Most visibly, the redesign draws on a key element of Facebook and Twitter, introducing a ""news feed"" of live, endlessly scrollable content, which includes news stories, videos, and messages from advertisers. The overhaul, which has a clean look and dramatic highlights in purple, was led in part by Jackie Goldberg, Yahoo's design director and a former creative director at Hewlett-Packard. Mayer says she met with the team once a week over the past few months. The redesign also gives Yahoo new opportunities to host advertisements on its most profitable real estate."
2013^  The Roppongi Hills studio is central to YouTube's first significant effort at audience-building in Asia. The online video giant's other two studios, in Los Angeles and London, help popular creators develop original programming for its online video channels. In Japan, YouTube's biggest regional success story in Asia, the company is recruiting online video stars to bolster its local-language channels with more targeted original programming and higher production values. Local programming is important for advertisers who want to reach Asian audiences, says Trevor Healy, Singapore-based CEO of mobile advertising agency Amobee. In Japan, YouTube and other Google video sites had 50.8 million unique viewers in December, a 30% rise over the same period a year earlier, according to comScore data.
2013^  The transaction adds Yahoo to the list of established Internet companies, including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., that have spent $1 billion or more apiece to buy startup companies in hopes of gaining an edge in growth. Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's deal for Tumblr gives Yahoo, one of the original big Internet companies, a fast-growing Web service that could fill one of its many holes--namely, the lack of a thriving social-networking and communications hub.
2013^"  Twitter quietly rolled out a new feature -- or irritant, depending on how you look at it -- for users of its Web site on Tuesday, as well as for its iOS and Android apps: Photo and video previews now show up as expanded images directly in a tweet instead of requiring users to click on a link. Some fans of the move welcomed the new feature, but others seemed taken aback by all the multimedia filling their streams, and by the Facebook-style feel it gives to Twitter. In addition to appealing to advertisers, which now get to insert what amount to banner ads into their streams the feature is likely aimed at attracting new users and encouraging them to use Twitter -- something the tech industry calls ""on-boarding."""
2013^"  VivendiSA's Universal Music Publishing Group has struck deals with Maker Studios Inc. and Fullscreen Inc., two of the biggest ""multichannel networks""--a new breed of digital entertainment companies that distribute, promote and sometimes produce videos specifically made for Google Inc.'s YouTube."
2013^  Wall Street Journal reporter Katherine Rosman recently invited YouTube creators and behind-the-camera marketers and brokers to discuss how the creative process can become a business in an . John McCarus, at the advertising agency Digitas, whose clients include Whirlpool and Sprint Is it difficult to convince consumer-product advertisers to invest in advertising on YouTube, a platform with a demographic and content that can be very different from broadcast and cable programming?
2013^"  What's different with ""Some Girl(s)"" is that it marks the first new release to use the Vimeo On Demand platform, which gives filmmakers a generous 90% cut of the revenue generated by the film -- compared with 70% on iTunes, or 50% from a cable operator -- and complete control over pricing and marketing."
2013^  [...]YouTube has altered some of its policies to help video creators generate more revenue.
2013^  [...]YouTube has changed some of its policies to help video creators generate more revenue from their videos, both on and off the site.
2014^ In the past 25 years the cost of broadcast rights for English Premier League soccer has surged thirty-fold as deep-pocketed media companies have grown to depend on live sports to win subscribers and keep them from defecting to online rivals. Next year an even richer bunch -- those same Internet giants that are wooing television viewers -- will likely show up at rights auctions, pushing prices even higher. Live sports attracts a passionate fan base, Greg Hart, video chief at Amazon.com Inc, said in August after signing a deal to offer Association of Tennis Professionals matches on Prime Video.
2014^  According to Kathleen Grace, owner of production company New Form Digital, a series of big-name companies such as YouTube and Verizon has been pouring money into digital-video offerings, most trying to differentiate themselves with shows or movies that can't be found elsewhere. Because many of them are asking customers to pay, rather than have them only watch ads, those companies have to work that much harder to draw in viewers. Digital-video producers, especially those focused on programming for smartphones, are enjoying something they didn't have a few years ago: a seller's market. Call it the Netflix effect. The streaming leader's steady push into original shows and movies has forced rivals such as Amazon.com and Hulu to do the same. The new competitors, including YouTube Red and Go90, have learned the lesson. Exclusivity has worked effectively for Netflix, said Peter Csathy, the CEO of consultant Manatt Digital Media.
2014^  Among big consumer Web businesses, there may be no tougher battlefield than video sharing. For video connoisseurs, though, the mainstream services leave a big gap: None combine the reliable, ad-free HD video of Netflix with the kind of marketplace democracy that birthed YouTube's endless stream of cat videos. It's a gap that Vimeo, the video-sharing site loved by artsy filmmakers and long ignored by the market, is starting to fill. Ad-free since its founding in 2004, Vimeo receives about 100 million unique viewers a month through its home page and from other sites that embed its video player, according to CEO Kerry Trainor. The company introduced its on-demand video service to lure more filmmakers and boost subscription sales. So far the site's 4,400 on-demand videos fall somewhere between Netflix's original series and YouTube.
2014^  AOL executives trotted out the company's new slate of original video programming on Tuesday, part of the increasingly crowded digital NewFronts in New York. A room full of potential advertisers gazed on a lineup larded with big-name talent, including James Franco, Steve Buscemi, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Ellen DeGeneres. But in the end, one established star from the television universe overshadowed all the other would-be transplants scrambling to make a go of it online: Nielsen. For years, Nielsen has dominated the role of measuring television audiences while struggling to achieve the same kind of hegemony online. Over the past year, as part of an ongoing competition with the likes of ComScore, Nielsen has rolled out a number of new Web-audience measuring tools designed to strengthen its still tenuous standing in the evolving firmament.
2014^  A question about how to successfully monetize Web videos are answered. Most independent producers are hobbyists, posting homemade videos for friends and family without worrying about making money from their efforts. But others are finding ways to profit from their videos, and some are even turning them into lucrative, full-time entrepreneurial ventures. The first part -- reaching a targeted viewership -- is not difficult for many online content producers. Most are making videos about their own interests and expertise and aiming them at narrow slices of viewers. Yet even a highly targeted audience can be huge: A beauty industry survey released in February by video software analysis company Pixability counted 700 million YouTube beauty video views every month. That gets into the second key to monetization: building a loyal audience large enough to interest advertisers. Finally, devote the time to interact with your viewers and subscribers.
2014^  As an alternative to election night coverage, HBO will launch The Offseason: Kevin Durant, an hour-long documentary about how last season's National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player spent the summer. The Offseason is part of trend whereby star athletes become their own media wings. No longer content just to play the games and give quotes to reporters, the most sought-after players are now writing first-person stories, running digital media startups, and producing television and online videos. The show is not so much a documentary as an hour-long advertisement.
2014^"  As anyone with a young child knows, a storybook or cartoon is the ultimate in ""long-tail"" media consumption: The 53rd rereading or re-watching is cherished just as much as the first time. And that's good news for Netflix, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs. The streaming-video giant has invested heavily in content for children at a time when kids are spending more time on mobile devices. Another positive: Kids have no tolerance for scheduled television, believing this should be an on-demand world, all the time -- Goldman knows kids are like that -- and Netflix follows no rigid programing schedule."
2014^  A simmering dispute between Google and independent record labels could result this week in the disappearance from YouTube of Adele, the Arctic Monkeys, and additional artists signed to smaller labels. YouTube is in the process of creating a paid subscription service to go alongside its existing service, and the online-video giant has been negotiating deals with artists. This would seem a good thing for the music industry: Labels make more money when fans listen to songs on paid subscription services than they do when fans use YouTube as a free music player. For the most part, labels are on board with the plan. YouTube says 95% of artists have signed deals. But the fight over the final 5% is getting nasty. A number of indie labels are holding out because they don't like the terms they've been offered, and songs that aren't covered by the new streaming service will soon be removed from YouTube altogether.
2014^  Billions of dollars may be at stake in the final round of the legal dispute between broadcast networks and the online streaming service Aereo, but the case will come down to the interpretation of two words: public performance. Aereo, a two-year-old startup funded by Barry Diller's IAC, charges viewers in about a dozen US markets $8 a month to record or stream live broadcast television signals to their PCs, smartphones, and tablets using dime-size antennas. On Apr 22, the Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments about whether Aereo's distribution of broadcasts infringes copyright law, which says that the rights holder controls the public performance of art -- music, plays, television shows, films. Aereo argues that a court decision against it would threaten a broad range of cloud computing services, because depending on how broad the decision is, it might restrict personal storage of media that users stream themselves. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
2014^  Bloomberg View's Jonathan Weill calls attention to the case of Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who appears to have single-handedly sent the stock price of a UK company plummeting after publishing an article on his Web site last week. Edelman says that digital media company Blinx, which was recently worth more than $1.2 billion, employs Internet advertising techniques, including pop-up ads, that users dislike, and that cause advertisers to be charged for video ads systematically not visible to users.
2014^  Considering the popularity of food and cooking shows on television -- from traditional how-to programs to contrived competitions -- it's only natural that food videos are proliferating online too. Subscriptions to the 300 most-viewed food channels on YouTube more than tripled in 2013 over the previous year and views of videos on those channels jumped 59%, according to a new analysis by Google. Viewers seek everything from recipes to such cooking basics as how to grill. Still, many food videos that go viral have one other component in common -- they're entertaining in the sense that they're absurd, or at least kind of silly, which is one way these online videos distinguish themselves from their rivals on television. Ten of the most-watched food and beverage videos published on YouTube in June are presented.
2014^  DirecTV is launching a Spanish-language streaming service in the US, allowing people to pay $7.99 a month for online access to movies, television shows, and sports in Spanish, even if they don't pay for the company's satellite-television service. DirecTV isn't a complete stranger to online video -- its DirecTV Everywhere platform lets subscribers watch some content on mobile devices and PCs -- but the streaming service hints at the potential for online television products to come. For DirecTV, a major attraction of developing the Spanish-language service, which it calls Yaveo, is to begin building the skills the company will need to get into the broader Internet television business. Starting with a niche service makes sense, in part because mainstream content companies have been suspicious of Internet television.
2014^  Disney plans to use Maker staff and tools to help put its existing content online, as well as to mine Maker's many channels for programs and personalities to exploit through the conglomerate's other businesses, said executive vice president of corporate strategy Kevin Mayer.
2014^  Dollar Shave Club, a startup launched two years ago on the strength of a single, silly viral video, has started to grow up. More than a million customers spend about $7 million each month to get razor blades and other grooming products in the mail. Becoming a serious business hasn't changed the tenor of the ads -- still sophomoric and hilarious -- but Dollar Shave Club has shifted its marketing focus from YouTube to traditional television commercials. In the past two years, as Dollar Shave and its competitors ramped up, the number of razors sold at convenience stores has sunk by 2% and the number of blades sold in those shops plummeted by 19%, according to Nielsen data.
2014^  Every lovestruck teenager in the 1990s made mixtapes they thought were priceless. Google's acquisition of Songza, an online music service, shows that having a talent for mixtapes can net you at least $39 million. The initial genius of online radio was to have computers choose what songs played next, giving rise to a seemingly infinite universe of customized radio stations. Algorithmic disc jockeys (or video curators and news-feed editors) have become standard in most digital media businesses. Songza has a more refined ear. At its office in Queens, one finds a roomful of humans that sit around making playlists all day. The company's formula isn't immune to algorithms -- it uses them in hopes of serving the best playlist at a particular time.
2014^"  Figuring out how to show video ads to users will be tricky for Facebook, since the company has indicated that it doesn't plan to run ""preroll"" ads -- the TV-like video ads that run before online videos and are the industry standard."
2014^  For the past three years, 27-year-old Ohio native Jessica Beinecke has scripted, acted in, and recorded about five episodes a week of OMG! Meiyu (OMG! American language) -- her hit Internet program that teaches Chinese students American slang. Beinecke's short, spunky videos quickly went viral on Chinese social media in 2011. This year, Beinecke decided to flip her format and make videos geared toward the growing number of young Americans trying to learn Mandarin. Crazy Fresh Chinese went online in January with sponsorship from the 100,000 Strong Foundation, a Department of State initiative started in early 2013 with the goal of encouraging Americans to study Mandarin. A typical video of OMG! Meiyu or Crazy Fresh Chinese starts with Beinecke acting out a situation and explaining how to use slang.
2014^  For years after 1989, when the first episode of America's Funniest Home Videos, aka AFV, aired in prime time on ABC, creator Vin Di Bona trained millions of amateur videographers to mail him their best material. But along came the Internet, and suddenly people no longer needed a television show to share their kid's hilarious trampoline accident with a mass audience. Nevertheless, AFV remains a formidable force in television. In October the series kicked off its 25th season on ABC, making it the network's longest-running prime time entertainment series. But for the first time, AFV is also aggressively extending its brand across the Web, catering to new fans on Facebook, Twitter, image-hosting site Imgur -- and the once-feared YouTube in particular. The show currently operates three YouTube channels: AFV Official, AFV Animals, and AFV Kids, with more YouTube features on the way.
2014^  Founded by former Hulu Chief Executive Jason Kilar, the company has raised $75 million in venture capital, according to Crunchbase, and is looking to secure programming ahead of a planned launch by the end of the year.
2014^  Google appears to have reached an agreement to buy Twitch, a company whose main business is live-streaming videos of people playing video games. A pending deal was first reported by Variety in May, and now VentureBeat says an arrangement has been finalized and will be worth more than $1 billion. If such a deal goes through, it would be a massive validation for the burgeoning industry of watching other people play games.
2014^"  Google has already been winning the Super Bowl for weeks. The tech giant's YouTube platform has welcomed a windfall from companies trying to build buzz for the lavish commercials they will air during the big game. Some 17 corporations have already posted ""teaser ads"" on YouTube, according to Google, and while they're free to post, these companies are paying for promotion spots on mastheads, through search results, and in front of other YouTube videos. Ironically, as Super Bowl airtime becomes more expensive, it has become critical for companies to spend heavily to prime viewers. Google, meanwhile, expects the Super Bowl ad blitz to come earlier next year."
2014^  Google Inc.'s YouTube may give viewers the option to watch ad-free videos for a fee, according to a top executive at the Internet giant, a big change from the advertising-only approach that turned it into the world's largest online video website.
2014^  If there is anything educational to be gleaned from time-wasting games such as Angry Birds, it's that the app store is a fickle benefactor. Rovio, the Finnish company that makes the game, is now feeling the impact of shifting tastes and trying to move beyond printing money in the form of one-dollar game downloads. The revenue Rovio made from gaming dropped from 2012 to 2013, the company said on Monday, and its profit fell more than 50%. All is not lost: Rovio did bring in more overall revenue than it did the year before and made $37 million in post-tax profit. And the folks behind Angry Birds have known for some time that the music won't play forever, which is why they have been trying to learn how to do two things very differently this time around.
2014^  In their pursuit of controlling our every waking hour, tech giants have long tried to commandeer the television experience, and they have the bruises to show for it. Google and Apple, along with startup Roku, have managed to establish modestly popular set-top boxes that stream some movies and live shows to televisions. Now a new contestant has joined the battle for the living room. At a New York press conference on April 2, e-commerce giant Amazon.com unveiled Amazon Fire TV, a small, boxy device designed to stream the company's catalog of free and paid shows and movies into the living room and let users play online video games on their large-screen televisions. This is an ambitious frontal assault on the few businesses that can afford to outspend the retail giant, but for Amazon the potential rewards are uniquely obvious.
2014^  In what may be another signal that Facebook Inc. wants to take on YouTube, the company has reached out to some of the Google Inc.-owned video site's biggest content producers and encouraged them to test distributing their videos on the social network, say people familiar with the matter.
2014^"  Kim Kardashian is the author's matchmaker. She's just set her up with a cute guy named Mitchell, who's a writer but ""not one of those nerdy sitcom writers,"" as she puts it. She meet Mitchell at Panino, a trendy restaurant in Beverly Hills, and opt to ""flirt"" with him. The Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game is currently the fourth most downloaded free app on iTunes -- and also the No.4 top-grossing one. The company behind it, Glu Mobile, which also owns games such as Deer Hunter and Contract Killer, revealed in a July 30 earnings call that Hollywood generated $1.6 million during its first five days on the market (it came out on June 25, and has taken over countless lives since)."
2014^  Nathalie Tadena and Suzanne Vranica Maker Looks to Building Brand Beyond YouTube Maker Studios, one of the biggest producers of programming on YouTube, is looking to cozy up to marketers that want to master Web video -- even as the company looks to develop its own consumer brand.
2014^  Netflix accounts for about a third of North America's Internet traffic on a typical evening, and VP for content delivery Ken Florance's team of 50 is charged with keeping the movies and television shows rolling. It's an enormous responsibility. On July 21 the company said its subscriptions had crossed the 50 million mark, accounting for $1.15 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up from $837 million in the same period last year. Florance, a happy-go-lucky pacifist with a cackle of a laugh, is now defending Netflix's interests in one of the nastiest fights in online history: the battle with Internet service providers (ISPs) and regulators over the fundamental structure of the Web. ISPs argue that Netflix takes up too much bandwidth and so any interruptions aren't their problem. Netflix's struggles with the ISPs are in some ways a reflection of its failure to negotiate traffic-sharing partnerships.
2014^  Netflix could one day hit a wall in its US subscriber growth -- with every American who wants it already subscribing -- but that day is certainly not here yet. The video subscription service added 2.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, including free trial subscriptions, giving it a total of 33.4 million in the US. That was enough to top the 33.1 million average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. At peak times, Netflix viewers represent about a third of US broadband Internet capacity, according to some estimates.
2014^  Netflix's second-quarter results popped out Monday afternoon, and here are the highlights: The company posted revenue of $1.15 billion vs. $837 million in the same period last year. Its net income hit $71 million, up from $29 million, and it now has more than 50 million customers worldwide -- 50.05 million, to be precise. Investors gave Netflix a pat on the back for increasing its subscribers at a healthy clip, sending shares 1% higher in after-hours trading. Netflix has spent more and risked more to become a real competitor to HBO and Showtime in programming while maintaining a technology edge over everyone.
2014^  Nickelodeon will on Monday air the first episode of ReactToThat, a television show based on the steady stream of skits, sitcoms, and assorted silliness produced by two of YouTube's biggest stars, brothers from Brooklyn named Benny and Rafi Fine. ReactToThat is basically Kids Say the Darndest Things for the YouTube generation, with panels of children asked to weigh on various cultural and social phenomena. Their success has resulted in a strange sort of obscure celebrity. Hollywood is paying increasing attention to artists who have already made names for themselves online, a reflection of just how big YouTube creators have become among young people. Kids now think YouTube's stars shine brighter than those of Hollywood celebrities, according to a survey of 1,500 teenagers conducted in July for Variety by Jeetendr Sehdev, a professor of marketing at the University of Southern California. The fledgling crossovers from YouTube to the offline entertainment industry is also an acknowledgement of the difficult economics of Web video.
2014^  On first viewing, it's really cute, that animated Coca-Cola commercial starring a puffin who can't open his bottle and the kindly polar bear who comes to his rescue. But lately people have been fantasizing about plucking the feathers off that smarmy puffin's wings. It's not that people hate polar birds; it's just that they have been forced to watch that ad about 100,000 times while using NBC's otherwise admirable streaming portal, nbcolympics.com. Unlike traditional television broadcasts in which advertisers purchase airtime during commercial breaks, NBC's online operation accepted ads only from its major sponsors for Olympics coverage. The perverse consequence is that by midway in any given event, people had endured Coke's tundra tear-jerker at least a half-dozen times, with few other offerings mixed in between. Repetition has become endemic in digital-video advertising for many sports broadcasts.
2014^  On Wednesday, Dec 17, two former Hulu executives offered a preview of their new company, Vessel. Like Hulu, the company will offer a free service with advertisements and a premium service with a subscription fee. In Vessel's case, the subscriptions will cost $2.99 a month and will feature exclusive content from creators who grant the company a three-day window during which videos will play only on its site. For months there have been rumors about potential YouTube competitors. Aside from the Vessel founders, much of the speculation has centered on George Strompolos, the CEO of YouTube network Fullscreen. If there's a way to succeed at this, Vessel is well positioned to do so.
2014^  Recent weeks have brought a steady stream of established television brands and personalities into the Internet's burgeoning world of direct-to-consumer entertainment networks. The list keeps growing: Glenn Beck, WWE, Paula Deen, and now even the illustrious HBO. CBS joined the digital race on Thursday with the launch of CBS All Access, a subscription-based, video-on-demand network that will allow viewers to binge-watch the broadcaster's programming via Internet-connected devices for $5.99 a month. One key factor driving the television programmers' rush to the Internet is that with each passing year more and more Americans are starting to watch some, if not all, of their television shows online. For home viewers, this means that a la carte online-television menu is about to get a lot more diverse and a lot more tempting.
2014^"  Rich Silverstein, co-founder and co-chairman of ad agency Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, creator of the ""Got Milk?"" and Budweiser Lizards campaigns, says the Facebook video ads will need ""visual seductiveness"" in the first three seconds. Former Apple Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs insisted on being involved in the creative process when Apple launched iAd for advertising inside apps in 2010."
2014^  Seven years ago Viacom demanded $1 billion from Google because YouTube was rife with videos that had been posted without regard for Viacom's copyrights. The two companies finally settled the dispute on Tuesday, with Re/Code reporting that no money changed hands. In a sense, Viacom finally gave in after signs mounted over the years that it wasn't going to win. A judge ruled in 2013 that it was Viacom's responsibility, not Google's, to find the offending videos. When Viacom filed its initial suit, Google had just begun to experiment with YouTube ads, and the entire online video advertising industry brought in about $580 million, far less than what Viacom itself made from advertising for its media networks.
2014^  Sony is the first company out of the gates with an online television package designed to fully replace a cable subscription. The product, first announced at CES back in January, finally has details and a name: PlayStation Vue. Other attempts at streaming-television services, most notably Intel's OnCue system, were stifled by a failure to strike deals with content companies. Sony already has a deal with Viacom to supply 22 channels, including Nickelodeon, MTV, and Comedy Central. Andrew House, the CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, acknowledges that sports are a must-have. The service will launch on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, and Sony is working on a version for iPads. A year after the PS4 hit the market, many core gamers have already bought consoles, and Sony sees entertainment as a way to goose sales for the next several years.
2014^  South by Southwest's film festival in Austin, Texas, ran an online program from 2004-08, and the Sundance Film Festival, held in Park City, Utah, hosts its first episodic story lab this fall, for writers and creators of content for online platforms and television.
2014^"  The company's need for non-movie revenue streams came into sharp relief on Tuesday, when DreamWorks announced a $57 million write-down related to ""Peabody,"" and a first-quarter net loss of $42.9 million, compared with net income of $5.6 million in the year-earlier period."
2014^"  The GoPro is a tiny, wearable camera, often used by skiers and surfers, that captures and produces high-quality video. Since March 2009, more than 620 GoPro-posted videos have attracted 440 million-plus views, according to YouTube spokesman Matt McLernon. GoPro's own channel ranks in the top 350 on YouTube, and the company's customers are even more prolific. The number of videos with ""GoPro"" in the title has grown so much that watching 2013's crop alone would take you 2.8 years. The privately held company keeps its financials confidential, and because of the pre-IPO ""quiet period"" mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, its executives aren't saying much right now. In December 2012, Foxconn Technology invested $200 million in GoPro, valuing the company at $2.3 billion. At the time, CEO Nicholas Woodman asserted that GoPro's revenue had been doubling every year, to $500 million in 2012."
2014^  The Internet was all in a tizzy Friday over a pressing issue of home entertainment. To paraphrase an infamous line from the hit sitcom, the prospect of Seinfeld on demand is real and it's spectacular. Chuck Larsen, the president of October Moon Television, an independent consulting firm that specializes in syndication rights, points out that Seinfeld's current syndication deals for both cable and broadcast television stations expire this fall. In the past, streaming subscription services such as Netflix might have balked at paying the huge syndication fees commanded by a top-shelf sitcom like Seinfeld. If Netflix does acquire the subscription video on demand rights, Larsen says, the series will continue to air on broadcast and cable television. And while it's likely that Seinfeld fans will soon have access to all 180 episodes somewhere online sometime soon, no deal has been announced yet.
2014^"  The publisher's Running Press imprint will release ""The Pointless Book"" on Tuesday in the U.S. CBS Corp.'s Simon &amp; Schuster has even started an imprint dedicated to YouTube personalities, Keywords Press, in partnership with United Talent Agency."
2014^  There is a Web site where cats and dogs rule the day, profanities are common, and clips from Lord of the Rings movies can be used to convey universal sentiments like the joy of revenge. Although it looks like just another photo-sharing hub, it's the best example yet of how a new generation of Internet users prefers to express itself. Imgur is a place to post and browse GIFs, the Internet's de facto file format for pictures and short, punchy animated clips designed for sharing on social networks. Imgur's already profitable, thanks to a stream of display ads from movie studios and video game publishers, and is well on its way to becoming one of the highest-traffic sites in the world, with more than 120 million monthly unique visitors posting images and searching for jolts of humor and insight.
2014^  The three major label groups, Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment and billionaire Len Blavatnik's Warner Music Group have struck deals with YouTube for the new music service.
2014^  The viral video strategy is savvy, not only because posting online is much cheaper than running traditional commercials, but also because of the target audience's growing spending power. In April 2013, Unilever's Dove scored the year's largest viral hit with its Real Beauty Sketches, which featured women surprised at how positively their looks are described by strangers. And even companies without female-centric products have gone the same route: Verizon showed a young girl admonished for pursuing technology and science, and Snickers created the confusingly titled You're Not You When You're Hungry, in which starving construction dudes accost women with positive comments. That hasn't stopped bloggers from complaining that the empowerment videos are gimmicky or condescending.
2014^  The Walking Dead is a true zombie show: Nearly every viewer becomes infected with the gruesome drama and, in turn, passes the infection to others. Consider Sunday's season premiere, the start of the fifth season of Walking Dead. Nielsen says 17.3 million households tuned into the episode, more than one million more than the show's previous peak, reached at last season's debut installment. What's more, about 11 million of the viewers on Sunday were in the 18-49 age range that so excites advertisers. By some measures, Walking Dead has been the most watched show in cable-television history for two years. It's only getting more popular. AMC Networks acknowledges that online video services have cultivated legions of new fans, many of whom don't pay for cable television and follow the zombie action on Netflix or iTunes.
2014^  The YouTube land grab continues: Otter Media, a joint venture between the Chernin Group and AT&amp;T, said it had bought a majority stake in Fullscreen, one of the biggest YouTube networks, in a deal that Bloomberg reports is valued between $200 million and $300 million. It's just the latest in a steady stream of acquisitions that mark the arrival of the really big money to the YouTube market. The world of online video, particularly the stuff favored by younger users, has been built by tiny operations drawing huge audiences to low-budget works. Such companies as Fullscreen came in over the last couple of years and promised professional services to help the little guys scale, signing up creators who thought they might not make it by themselves.
2014^  This month, Netflix, the world's largest subscription streaming video service, will offer the original series Orange Is the New Black and other programming to six European nations, including Germany and France. It aims to reduce its reliance on the US market and establish global dominance before Time Warner's HBO Go and Amazon.com's Prime Instant Video do. The big question is whether Netflix can navigate rules that shield homegrown media companies and local culture. Shows that play well in one country may not in another, so Netflix will have to localize at least some content, a costly undertaking. Netflix has said it aims to generate as much as 80% of sales outside the US. In the past year, international revenue jumped 85%. To provide overseas customers with exclusive content, Netflix is buying worldwide rights to US television shows, including Fox's Gotham and new episodes of Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul.
2014^  This week Paula Deen capped off a summerlong comeback tour by appearing on the Today show to discuss the scandal over racist slurs that last year nearly destroyed her food and media empire and to explain what she's doing next. The following morning, on Wednesday, Sep 24, Deen threw open the doors to her new digital-only subscription media venture, the Paula Deen Network, which is charging $9.99 for a monthly subscription, or $95.88 for a full year. Throughout it all, Deen shows off the familiar persona she spent decades crafting on air at the Food Network -- Southern, maternal, sassy, and just a little bit crass. Everywhere you look on the new site, Deen is front and center, tossing out catchphrases, frying meat, and cackling wildly. No character overhaul here. She'll need it, because the demographics of that world are against her: Digital video networks tend to cater to (and be consumed by) the young and the cable-less.
2014^  Three decades after his song-parody debut, Weird Al Yankovic is on track to have his first No. 1 album. The final sales numbers won't be released until later this week, but Billboard magazine has him neck and neck with Jason Mraz for the top spot. For years, Yankovic's shtick depended on the existence of the MTV-watching, album-purchasing public. Now his publicity and distribution model is doubly obsolete, and thousands of YouTube-empowered enthusiasts are doing exactly what Weird Al does -- and at a much quicker pace than a major-label release schedule allows. The Internet should have made Weird Al Yankovic irrelevant years ago. In fact, it has done the opposite. There is one other reason why Yankovic has stayed remarkably relevant over the past 30 years: his music. And his subject matter is usually more approachable than the original pop songs.
2014^"  Three years after Netflix increased its prices and sparked a painful backlash that savaged its share price, executives at the online-video service are once again testing various prices and streaming combinations beyond $7.99 per month for new members. Last spring, Netflix started an option aimed at families to allow four simultaneous streams for $11.99 per month, and the company has been testing different prices for standard resolution, high definition, and concurrent streaming options. In December, the company began a $6.99 monthly plan that allows streaming to only one screen, and executives spoke of their efforts to find a three-tier ""good, better, best"" pricing plan."
2014^  [...]users must sit through ads, and music fans usually have to pick songs one at a time, rather than entire albums or custom playlists. Besides no ads, users of the new music service on mobile devices are expected to be able to keep playing songs while they use other apps, as well as to store music for offline listening for a short period according to people who have seen preliminary versions of the product.
2014^  Variety is one of the true joys of the Olympics, a three-week span during which viewers can watch athletes from around the world skiing through the woods with guns, going on spandex-clad sled rides, and soaring above a crappy snowboard halfpipe, all within the course of an hour. But if you're watching NBC's online coverage, better brace yourself for some mind-numbing repetition: The same BP commercial has run three times in four minutes during a replay of the men's moguls, and one spot for Bounty paper towels played three times in a row during a single break. Seeing the same cluster of commercials repeated over an hours-long broadcast isn't unusual for sports fans. But what's merely annoying on television can be torturous for streaming video audiences, where the ad inventory tends to be far more limited.
2014^  Vevo, a joint venture of Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment that owns the rights to stream music videos on ad-supported services like Google Inc.'s YouTube, also is exploring a sale.
2014^  Viacom Inc. resolved copyright litigation with Google Inc. over the tech giant's YouTube video site, ending a seven-year legal fight that became a symbol of tensions between media companies that produce content and websites that let users share it.
2014^  Walt Disney Co. is in talks to acquire popular online-video producer Maker Studios for about $500 million, said people with knowledge of the discussions, a deal that could give the entertainment giant better access to a young teen audience whose tastes are shifting to Web-based video.
2014^  When Brian Robbins first told people he was going full time into the YouTube business, his colleagues in Hollywood were incredulous. For decades, Robbins had worked in the traditional entertainment industry, first as a teenage actor starring in the ABC sitcom Head of the Class, then as a producer of television shows about teenagers. It was steady and lucrative work, if not always the most prestigious. Robbins's timing was good. After years of more or less passive support, YouTube was starting to take an active role in original programming, encouraging entrepreneurs, producers, and established television stars to start channels, which on YouTube refers to a collection of videos hosted by an individual or by a creative team. In Jun 2012, Robbins launched his YouTube channel, which he named AwesomenessTV. The channel was geared to teenagers and preteens and featured lots of two- to five-minute videos, which ranged from quickie talk shows about beauty tips to mini-reality shows about cheerleaders.
2014^  Yahoo Inc. is in preliminary talks to acquire online-video service News Distribution Network Inc., a deal that would help Chief Executive Marissa Mayer compete with Google Inc.'s YouTube for viewers and ad dollars.
2014^"  Yahoo was the fourth-largest video site, with 52 million viewers, trailing Facebook Inc. and AOL Inc. For ""Community,"" the show's jump to streaming TV brings it that much closer to fulfilling the online chant for #SixSeasonsAndaMovie, a reference to a quote from one TV-obsessed character that turned into a rally cry for fans and cast members."
2014^  Yet another popular television show has been plucked from the scrapheap by a fledgling online-video platform. This time it's Yahoo Screen buying an all-new season of Community, a Sony sitcom that NBC canceled in May after a five-season run. Such matchups between a castoff and an underdog platform are becoming an increasingly common twist in the entertainment industry's script. There are only two alternatives to buying new versions of defunct shows: airing reruns or bankrolling original shows. But it's hard to win attention with reruns, and creating new shows can be a fraught path, particularly for a media company such as Yahoo! that has no record of success in scripted programming.
2014^  YouTube has been nibbling around the edges of the television industry's $60 billion lunch for some time now. Last night The Information reported that Susan Wojcicki is the candidate likely to take over the video site; Google has neither confirmed nor denied the report. In any case, the challenges for the head of YouTube are clear: The site is one of Google's biggest opportunities to make billions in ad dollars without convincing users to do something differently than what they're already doing. The job now is to get YouTube to grow up. In a way, Wojcicki is an ideal choice, given her deep experience in advertising. But she'd have to help Google develop some new muscles. Video ads are about branding, an arena in which success is harder to measure and habits are deeply ingrained.
2014^  YouTube takes a 45% cut of ad sales generated by videos on its network, but video creators don't have to share revenue derived from merchandising or branded entertainment--where a company's products are featured in what otherwise looks like conventional entertainment.
2015^"  [...]according to Anne-Marie Klein, vice president of global media for the science-based hair care products company Living Proof, there is influencer gold to be mined on YouTube for smaller brands willing to use the right technology to look. Since OpenSlate and others help measure channels' ability to drive comments, sharing and other forms of engagement--rather than just pure view numbers, ""you can find influencers that are trending but are not the biggest ones,"" she said."
2015^  According to Justin Maiman, executive editor, video for Business Insider, the two sites' September growth wasn't the result on a sudden increase in output on Facebook or a single viral clip, but rather a culmination of the company's devotion to video.
2015^  According to Ms. Lagani, Hearst plans to provide advertisers with guarantees of how many times their influencer-produced content will be viewed, based on these influencers typical audience deliveries.
2015^  According to research by ad-blocking measurement service PageFair, approximately 5% of Internet users globally used ad blocking tools during the second quarter of 2014, up from around 3% for the same period in 2013.
2015^"  According to Vimeo Chief Executive Kerry Trainor, ""The Outs"" has a larger fan base than ""High Maintenance"" did prior to its second season."
2015^  According to Vine's parent company Twitter, 200 million people watch Vine content each month globally. [...]Vine's unique format is big on Facebook -- people even create entire pages devoted to compilations of top Vines.
2015^  Among subscription video services, Netflix Inc. dominates, followed by Amazon.com Inc., Hulu and others that have a strong presence in individual markets outside the U.S. Jonathan Miller, partner at early stage investment firm Advancit Capital and former chief digital officer at News Corp, pointed to important differences between the digital-music industry, where competitors essentially have the same catalog of songs, and the digital-video business, where rivals bid for the choicest offerings. Mr. Verna said there are synergies between music and video entertainment, citing the successful expansion of Apple's iTunes store from selling digital music to also offering movies, TV shows and podcasts.
2015^  As a working mom, Abbie Schiller relied on 30 minutes of television in the morning and the evening to keep her toddler occupied. There was plenty of programming that taught kids to count and spell, but the Los Angeles resident saw a void when it came to social and emotional learning. So Schiller, who was head of public relations for ABC Daytime, improvised. Schiller left ABC in 2007 to focus full time on creating videos and books that help kids cope with strong emotions, like jealousy and anger, and sticky situations, like getting lost. She and her husband, Marc Gordonson, a digital advertising executive, sold their house and moved in with her parents.
2015^"  As soon as Chad Horstman saw the YouTube video of a rat dragging a slice of pizza in the New York City subway, he knew it should be a Halloween costume. It was just so obvious, says Horstman, 37, founder of the online lingerie and costume store Yandy.com. They try to make things that people are going to instantly recognize, he says. With viral videos, it's pretty easy. Yandy expects $1 million in costume sales this year, about 30% of which will come from ""trend"" costumes -- outfits relevant only in 2015. Today, the more controversial a costume is, the more likely it is to go viral. When that happens, the real benefit for a manufacturer is marketing, not sales revenue."
2015^  At a time when YouTube personalities are being cast in feature films and Vine celebrities are shooting television commercials for Hewlett-Packard, social media stars are attractive to advertisers eager to captivate young eyeballs. YouNow, which the analytics firm App Annie ranks seventh in the US among iOS social networking apps by gross revenue, is a favorite. The company says it logs 100 million user sessions each month, with visitors spending an average of 50 minutes a day, whether broadcasting their own videos or viewing those of others. Unlike YouTube, Vine, and most other amateur-video services, though, YouNow doesn't allow advertising. Instead, it relies on viewers to tip the people who make videos they like, taking a 30% cut for itself. People on YouNow agree to do things in exchange for followers or tips but the culture of the site shuns the exhibitionism-for-hire found on adult sites.
2015^"  A YouTube representative helped Elise Strachan, creator of the popular channel ""MyCupcakeAddiction,"" apply for a grant from a joint venture between the Australian government and Google that funds higher-quality online video production."
2015^  [...]big music services start paying the creators of the individual tracks he puts in his mixes, he said, he can't release them to very wide audiences, since he doesn't have time to get clearance for every song himself.\n
2015^"  Corrections &amp; Amplifications Including visits via mobile devices, more than half of YouTube's users access the online-video service directly, according to a spokesman for Google Inc. A Business &amp; Tech article Thursday about YouTube's contribution to Google's profits incorrectly said most YouTube users reach the service via links or embedded video players on other sites. Josh Jacobs, chief executive of Accuen, the programmatic-advertising arm of Omnicom Group Inc., says ad buyers want to reach young fans as they build brand ""affinities."""
2015^"  Even for the ""Worst Company in America,"" it's been a rough year. Comcast, the largest US cable provider, got that title -- and the Golden Poo trophy that comes with it -- from Consumerist, the advocacy blog owned by Consumer Reports, in April 2014. Customers surveyed in its hometown of Philadelphia said they regard its service as ""lousy"" or ""non-existent."" In February the company began sending customers personalized online billing videos that explain extra charges such as movie purchases. In March it expanded the team handling customer complaints via Facebook and Twitter from 20 employees to 60. It's testing a smartphone app that lets customers track the location of the technician headed their way."
2015^  Even while working in 2013 to nail down one of the biggest corporate purchases ever, the $130 billion acquisition of joint-venture partner Vodafone Group PLC's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam made several trips to Silicon Valley to discuss a TV deal with Intel Corp., people familiar with the matter said.
2015^"  Ever since Susan Kare's 8-bit designs graced the first Macintosh screens in 1984, icon design, like digital typography, has been an important if unglamorous niche in the software business. The 2008 debut of Apple's App Store created a sea change in the industry, says Gedeon Maheux, co-founder of Iconfactory, a large design studio in Greensboro, NC, that does work for big brands such as Windows and Twitter. Icons and glyphs -- the term for symbols that blur the line between typography and pictograms, such as the triangular ""play"" button on online videos -- must be drawn for every screen size that Silicon Valley produces, from 5K resolution monitors to smart appliances and wearables. Even the tiniest icons start out big on designers' screens. This isn't merely for convenience while drawing them: Many clients require large-format versions of the icons for use in offline marketing materials. Multiple device resolutions are another issue."
2015^  Facebook also said it would start sharing ad revenue with video creators in a bid to attract more high-quality videos to the social network and grab a piece of advertisers' television budgets. [...]Facebook today resembles even more closely a younger Google--growing rapidly with enviable profit margins.
2015^  [...]Facebook has relied on technology partner Audible Magic to help it identify unauthorized video content through audio fingerprinting.
2015^  First and most obvious is that Facebook lacks an established ad revenue model for content producers.
2015^  For a spinoff of Breaking Bad that's meant to be a prequel, Better Call Saul opens in a strange place: the kitchen of a Cinnabon in a Nebraska mall, some time after the closing credits rolled five seasons of the show's forebear. The man behind the counter, sporting a bushy mustache but missing his trademark hairpiece, is Saul Goodman, the crooked defense attorney who played a supporting role on Breaking Bad. Since the days of Laverne &amp; Shirley and Frasier, spinoffs have been a time-honored way for network executives to exploit an established audience. Thanks to Netflix and other online-video services, the audience for Breaking Bad increased over time, with average weekly viewers climbing to 5.4 million the last season, according to Nielsen.
2015^"  For marketers and content creators distributing videos on Facebook, the goal is to produce ""thumb-stoppers""--videos with images so compelling that users will stop scrolling through their news feeds on their phones, even when there's no sound. According to Mr. Kydd, Tastemade edits videos specifically with Facebook's unique qualities in mind."
2015^  For more than a decade, pirating a movie or television show using BitTorrent, the Internet's notorious file-sharing protocol, required a modicum of work and technical ability. You had to use a clunky program specially designed to seek out and decode pirated files, then learn to refine its search tools to find the videos you wanted. Annoying banner ads within the search program were part of the deal, as was occasional malware. Pirating wasn't just a pain for the Hollywood studios whose products were being passed freely around the Web; it was a pain for unscrupulous seekers of free video, too. In the past year, a program called Popcorn Time has become the kinder, gentler face of piracy online, taming BitTorrent to make it far more user-friendly and less obviously sketchy. Although it's difficult to estimate total viewership of a pirate service, in Netflix's latest annual report to shareholders CEO Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells named Popcorn Time a major worry.
2015^  From HBO and AMC to ESPN and the Tennis Channel, television networks have relied for decades on cable and satellite providers to distribute their programming. In the era of streaming video, they're trying to deliver shows and movies directly to viewers online, yielding a host of challenges more complex than negotiating fees with the likes of Comcast and DirecTV, says Paul Rehrig, SVP for business development at AMC. To build Shudder, Rehrig hired DramaFever, one of more than two dozen businesses working behind the scenes to set up dedicated online homes for old-school media companies. Some of the new online destinations make their money from ads; others, from subscriptions, like the small packages of streaming television channels out or coming by year-end from Comcast, Verizon, Dish Network, Apple, and Sony.
2015^  Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are launching gliders and blimps and laying fiber in the ground; cable TV operators are deploying Wi-Fi workarounds; there are now mobile-phone carriers in which Wi-Fi is the default; and cellular technology is the backup.
2015^  If successful, the effort will make Facebook a more serious threat to Google Inc.'s YouTube in online video. [...]Facebook has slotted video ads into users' news feeds.
2015^"  In January the messaging app Snapchat, known mostly for letting its young users share annotated photos that vanish shortly afterward, added a ""Discover"" feature, a menu of free channels from 11 media companies that publish video clips and news stories directly to Snapchat. Two people who work for Snapchat's channel partners say their daily video clips and written stories average more than 1 million viewers. Although it has an obsessive young audience coveted by advertisers that now totals more than 100 million, the app's main content is uniquely ephemeral, and the company says it doesn't track user behavior in the ways most social networks do to sell ads. Snapchat is also selling ads against feeds of short, nondisappearing videos from users, a feature called ""Live"" unveiled last summer. Some Live feeds have drawn more than 30 million viewers, say the three people familiar with Snapchat's viewership."
2015^  It's been a decade since YouTube became the first household name in Internet video. In 2008, at the first NewFronts, an annual online marketing conference, Google-owned YouTube had the overwhelming majority of the viewership. Hulu was new, and Facebook had added videos just the year before. At this year's NewFronts, April 27-May 7 in New York, 34 companies are promoting online shows and vying for ad dollars. While YouTube retains a healthy lead in the $7.8 billion US market for online video ads, it's not keeping pace with rivals' growth. Over the past two years, many production companies that reliably crank out hit videos, some now owned by big media companies, have spread their work to other services.
2015^  Linda Yaccarino, NBCU's chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships, declined to share any specifics on the deal, but implied that the company had been naturally headed in this direction given its ongoing embrace of digital media.
2015^"  Mr. Skogmo, a former clip hunter for shows such as ""Country Fried Home Videos,"" which he described as a ""redneck version of 'America's Funniest Home Videos,'"" saw an opportunity to create a stock footage house of viral videos that could serve as a one-stop shop for media platforms and a business manager for rights holders."
2015^  Not long ago, Clint and Wiley Hensley, twin 8-year-old brothers in Silver Spring, MD, made an important discovery. They realized they could use their family's Roku streaming player to watch SpongeBob SquarePants -- Nickelodeon's hit animated television series about a goofs' sponge and his neurotic underwater friends -- over the Internet through Amazon Prime Instant Video. Soon the twins were cycling through episodes until they'd lost count. Clint found Patrick, the dopey starfish, particularly hilarious. SpongeBob SquarePants began airing on Viacom's Nickelodeon in 1999, seven. years before the Hensley twins were born. Since then, significant changes -- the advent of Netflix, the rise of YouTube, the proliferation of DVRs, smartphones, tablets, etc. a -- have upended the home-entertainment market. The rise of on-demand viewing and social media -- SpongeBob has 59 million fans on Facebook -- has only helped drive the character further into viewers' lives. The SpongeBob film is the first from Paramount Pictures' dedicated animated division, which the company launched in 2011.
2015^  Other marketing tactics customers seem to like are the new brands' simplified websites, social-media marketing that can involve answering people's questions about products and in some cases, offering to pay customers $50 for each person they refer. [...]many customers are taking part in a form of social-media promotion--the unboxing video, which in this case shows what happens when someone unboxes a memory-foam mattress and the rolled up foam grows like a shriveled-up sponge hit with water. Investors in Casper range from established venture-capital firms to actor Leonardo DiCaprio, singer Adam Levine, and hip-hop artist Nas, according to The Wall Street Journal's Venture Capital Dispatch blog.
2015^  Record company executives have frequently complained that free, ad-supported music services such as YouTube don't generate enough revenue to sustain the music industry in the long term, and some are frustrated that Google has taken so long to offer the paid YouTube service.
2015^"  Rob Schwartz, chief executive officer of TBWA\Chiat\Day New York said there has always been bad adverting and the problem now lies partly with the ""plumbing of the Internet that has inundated us with content and ads."
2015^  Several big media companies had initially held out of signing onto Red because they didn't like the fact that the pool of subscription revenue generated would be shared by all content creators based on the amount of time people spend watching their content.
2015^  Several big media companies have agreed to make content available for a planned YouTube subscription service that will let consumers watch videos without any ads, despite their initial reservations, people familiar with the matter said.
2015^"  ""Social media is designed to be social, but a lot of people forget that,"" says Ted Murphy, chief executive of Izea, an agency that has helped organize social-media campaigns for Unilever, Walmart, ConAgra Foods and other big brands. In the mid-2000s, former marketing executive Wendy Piersall was struggling to generate revenue with her blogs on mother-related issues, until a post on children's activities in 2007 made the home page of Digg and sent her traffic soaring."
2015^  Technology companies including Facebook Inc., Snapchat and streaming-startup Vessel are promising large TV-channel owners better terms for their video programming than Google Inc.'s YouTube, hoping to capitalize on mounting frustration with the Web giant in the entertainment industry. Vessel, which was founded by Jason Kilar, the longtime chief executive of streaming site Hulu, is offering media companies about 70% of the ad revenue for its coming short-form video service, plus a cut of the $3-a- month subscription fee, if Vessel gets the content exclusively when it is first released, people familiar with the discussions say.
2015^  [...]that doesn't necessarily allow publishers to make money from videos that pop up in people's news feeds. Besides Facebook video, Mr. Peretti briefly touched on the recent $200 million investment from Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal .
2015^  [...]the company -- which built its business by helping manage thousands of YouTube stars -- wants to become more of a youth marketing brand consultancy, and one that is much less YouTube-dependent, says Chief Executive George Strompolos.
2015^"  The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday said Machinima, an early leader in so-called multichannel networks, paid ""influencers"" as part of marketing campaign managed by Microsoft's advertising agency, Starcom MediaVest Group."
2015^  The median age of prime-time TV viewing rose from 46.3 to 50.5 in the five years ending in June 2015, according to a Horizon Media analysis of Nielsen data.
2015^"  The most impressive entry so far is ""City of Scars,"" a $27,000, 30-minute film that could easily be a template for a low-budget Batman TV series, containing highly believable fights, chases and action sequences, as well as copious philosophizing and moralizing (""Gotham City is sick of Batman's conscience,"" Officer Montoya snarls, ""and so am I!"")."
2015^  [...]the only way fans could find NFL content on YouTube was through pirated clips, which are removed quickly, or fan-recorded footage from live games. [...]other websites won't be able to embed YouTube clips from the NFL channel.
2015^  The successful expansion by Netflix into Australia, Canada, Europe, and Latin America over the last five years has increased investor confidence in the streaming service's plan to build the first worldwide, online television network. By the end of 2016, CEO Reed Hastings wants to reach the rest of the globe, a sprint through more than 150 countries across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. That push begins with Netflix's September 2 entry into Japan, home to more broadband households than any of its current markets outside the US. Netflix figures the potential for an on-demand revolution exists, since much of Japan has access to broadband Internet at home, and people routinely watch videos over their mobile phones. The real challenge is to generate excitement in a place that isn't clamoring for Netflix, says Cameron Johnson, company executive working on the Japanese site. Hastings won't give hard numbers, but he's optimistic about Netflix's prospects.
2015^  The Super Bowl halftime show has become a showcase for some of music's biggest stars in recent years, from Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones to Beyonce, Prince, and Madonna. True to form, this year's broadcast, on February 1 on Comcast's NBC, will feature singer Katy Perry, one of pop music's biggest acts, with an assist by rocker Lenny Kravitz. Yet that star power isn't deterring YouTube from offering its own halftime show online, hosted by Harley Morenstein, the ringleader of food stunt group Epic Meal Time. The show, featuring some of YouTube's biggest stars, is part of a broader initiative to promote ads on the Google-owned site -- as well as to exploit America's cult of loving and hating the expensive ads that air during the Super Bowl, the year's most-watched television event. More than 60 million people subscribe to the channels of the participating creators, some of whom YouTube has promoted on billboards around the US.
2015^  The track record for celebrity games--there are apps out now and in development from singer-songwriter Demi Lovato, rapper Meek Mill and actor Jason Statham--is mixed. Dude Perfect, a group of five men known for sports and comedy videos, released two versions of a self-titled sports game with the help of professional game studios.
2015^  Using the screen name KittyPlaysGames, Kristen Valnicek was streaming herself playing death matches in various games, most frequently Counter-Strike, a popular first-person shooter. Fans follow her footage on a Web site called Twitch, which bills itself as a social network for video game fans. Typically, they watch Valnicek in a split-screen format, with her gameplay in one window and a smaller projection of her head and torso, captured via webcam, in another. Twitch, which was launched in 2011 as the side project of a floundering San Francisco startup, has grown into a global vortex of adolescent veneration. Twitch, which Amazon.com acquired in September 2014 for about $970 million, is the front-runner in this growing market, but it faces a serious challenge from a powerful adversary: Google's YouTube. Today, Twitch's headquarters are in an office building in downtown San Francisco. Most of the common areas are tricked out with video-game-inspired decor.
2015^  Walt Disney Co. is doubling down on Vice Media, investing another $200 million as the youth-focused media company prepares to launch its first cable television channel, according to people familiar with the matter.
2015^  When Amazon.com, Apple, and Google released updated versions of their streaming devices this fall, all three companies pitched them as a way to play video games on television. Roku is doing the opposite. While discussing the company's strategy shortly before the October 6 release of the Roku 4, CEO Anthony Wood had to be pressed to even mention gaming. Wood said that their attitude on gaming is that it's a feature, not a strategy. Roku has offered some games for years, but the CEO said he doubts his company's hardware or any of its direct competitors will make much headway with hard-core gamers. According to him, his competitors are misjudging the market because of the incredible success of mobile games.
2015^  Why would marketers be OK with all this, particularly since they are accustomed to getting access to sophisticated analytics dashboards on other social platforms? Because Snapchat, which claims to reach 100 million users a day and generates 6 billion video views a day , is currently seen as the promised land for reaching millennials and younger demographics. According to Delmondo Chief Executive Nick Cicero, Mercato will help brands calculate a slew of key data points forSnapchat influencers , including how big their followings are, their average engagement rates and the projected performance of their videos.
2015^  [...]Wildness plans to release some new proprietary research on this demographic's media and advertising attitudes next week during Advertising Week in New York.
2015^  YouTube is seeking streaming rights to TV series and movies to bolster its new subscription service, intensifying its rivalry with Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu in the competitive market for online video.
2016^  According to Mr. Norman, having direct access to Fullscreen's tools will help media buyers at various GroupM agencies evaluate which influencers might be right for their ad partners, based on the size of their followings, the kind of work they typically produce, and how their content resonates with their communities.
2016^"  According to the blog post, Vessel Chief Technology Officer Richard Tom ""will be leading the charge on all things technology, product and team going forward,"" while Mr. Kilar's focus ""will be to ensure a smooth transition through the end of this year."""
2016^"  According to the VAB, the closest comparison in television to the 36 million views that Fullscreen touted is the Nielsen metric called total audience, which rolls up how many times people are exposed to a show over a period of time. Like views, total audience doesn't filter out duplication. Since August, ""Pretty Little Liars"" has accumulated a total audience of over 61 million.\n"
2016^  Activision Blizzard Inc., looking to draw more eyeballs and advertising dollars to its competitive-videogame content, plans next month to begin publishing daily live programming on Facebook Inc. The companies announced the collaboration Thursday at the NewFronts digital-media conference in New York, where Activision Blizzard pitched marketers on its business of competitive videogaming, also called e-sports.
2016^  A fair number of publishing executives say they are now more bullish on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and, in some cases, even Twitter when it comes to amassing video audiences. According to Scott Grimes, co-founder and nonexecutive chairman of the young male-oriented web company Woven Digital, publishers need help standing out amid the sea of YouTube stars.
2016^"  Amid complaints from video creators that their content is being stolen and re-uploaded across Facebook, the company on Tuesday announced the release of a new rights management tool for video producers and companies that aims to combat the ""freebooting"" piracy issue."
2016^  As competitive gaming grows more popular, the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) is setting the pace. More than 330 million people watched some part of the league's four-week world championships last fall through channels like YouTube and gaming-video site Twitch. Bigger audiences and prizes are drawing a wave of outside investment, setting up a showdown between the league's past and its future. Since the fall, the money coming from outsiders, including veterans of the US pro sports industry, has begun to professionalize the league in ways big and small. The changes have rankled team owners who don't have access to that kind of cash, but the new money is also forcing tough conversations about how to run a pro league in which many players are teens. The arrival, of mainstream investors should make the industry seem safer to big advertisers, says Steve Arhancet, co-owner of the LCS squad Team Liquid, adding that he's unconcerned by the prospect of new money changing the league.
2016^  Big media distributors such as AT&amp;T, which owns DirecTV and delivers movies and television shows to 100 million subscribers of its wireless, Internet, and video services, have argued for years over which can best withstand the disruption brought about by online services like Netflix: Content providers? Or cable and satellite operators? With his surprise $85 billion takeover bid for Time Warner, Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T's CEO, is betting that the companies that will thrive in a world of streaming and smartphones must be both. The future of mobile is video, and the future of video is mobile, Stephenson said on October 22 after announcing the deal. Already, AT&amp;T and Time Warner have separately been working to make it easier for consumers to watch more movies and television shows online. Some analysts are skeptical of AT&amp;T's rationale, pointing to Time Warner's disastrous merger with America Online in 2000.
2016^"  ""Brands are saying, 'Let's make sure we are maximizing our spending and reaching new people.'"" Some advertisers who have worked with MCNs on custom ad efforts involving digital stars over the past few years say that these campaigns have required much more time and energy than buying pre-roll video ads programmatically or working with an individual influencer."
2016^  By 2020, video will account for about 75% of the world's mobile traffic, according to an estimate from networking-equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. Unless you have an unlimited data plan, it's a good idea to save live video for when you're on Wi-Fi.
2016^  Facebook Inc. has inked contracts with nearly 140 media companies and celebrities to create videos for its nascent live-streaming service, as the social network positions itself to cash in on a lucrative advertising market it has yet to tap--and keep its 1.65 billion monthly users engaged.
2016^"  Fullscreen will also feature ""Shane &amp; Friends,"" a celebrity talk show built around YouTuber Shane Dawson , and ""Kingdom Geek,"" which will feature Web video personalities Andre Meadows and Katie Wilson dissecting pop culture. Besides originals, the service will showcase older TV series like the aforementioned ""Dawson's Creek,"" MTV's late '90s animated hit ""Daria"" and former NBC Saturday morning staple ""Saved by the Bell."
2016^  Google has acquired FameBit, a technology startup that helps marketers connect with digital influencers, in an effort to bolster branded content deals in online video, including on Google's video platform YouTube.
2016^  In an effort ramp up its outreach to marketers, Studio71, a multichannel network that produces web video content, named Matt Seiler as president of marketing solutions, a newly created role.
2016^"  Kevin Reilly, president of Time Warner's TBS and TNT networks, points to ""Super Deluxe,"" a new outfit the company set up to make short-form mobile content--the theme, he said, is ""subversive comedy""--for social channels like Facebook and Snapchat and incubate long-form content that might get on TV. Emerging ""virtual"" cable providers--such as Sling TV, Sony and soon Hulu--present a big opportunity, but to really win over cord-cutters media companies and their investors will have to accept that not every one of the TV channels they own will make it into the ""skinny bundles"" of the future."
2016^  LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.--While Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are increasingly producing their own premium content, YouTube Chief Executive Susan Wojcicki said the world's largest video site is mainly focused on being a platform for other creators.
2016^"  Last week, the executive body for the European Union proposed plans that could make content on video-on-demand services from national broadcasters and a variety of streaming platforms available to all member countries, potentially enabling a hit show to debut around the continent at once. ""Release schedules for programs have been set in stone for decades,"" said Michael Goodman, director of digital media strategies at the market research firm Strategy Analytics."
2016^  Lilly Singh, a 27-year-old YouTube personality, has delighted teenagers for six years from the comfort of her couch. With almost 8 million subscribers following Singh's main channel for free, YouTube decided to invest in the Internet star when it heard she was making a documentary, A Trip to Unicorn Island. Google, which bought the video-sharing Web site in 2006 for $1.65 billion, plans to make YouTube more profitable by creating a revenue stream with Red. Like Netflix and Amazon.com, Google is offering original programs, but instead of Hollywood talent, Red is banking on the star power of homegrown personalities such as Singh to persuade fans to sign up.
2016^  Magna Global, the ad buying arm of Interpublic Group of Cos., has signed an upfront advertising deal with YouTube, shifting spending from television ads in an effort to reach consumers more efficiently.
2016^  Major league sports teams are recruiting a new kind of player: one who can score with a joystick. In the past two months, Manchester City and West Ham United, two of the top English Premier League soccer teams, have signed professional video gamers to represent the clubs when playing FIFA, a hugely popular Electronic Arts soccer video game. E-sports is now a $500 million industry, according to Deloitte, with a mostly millennial audience. Not long ago, those folks would have been fans of real-life sports; now they may not even subscribe to cable. Instead, they're more likely to interact online through fantasy sports or video games. Signing video players is an extension of the move over the past few years to professionalize e-sports.
2016^  Mr. Banner said he's hoping the marketing blitz, as well as the Super Bowl association, will help consumers make the connection that PepsiCo is not just a soda company, but also owns brands ranging from Sun Chips to Sabra Hummus.
2016^"  Mr. Neistat, who recently snowboarded around the snowy streets of Manhattan, said he and an assistant spent the first 36 hours after a video of that adventure went viral combing Facebook and YouTube for ""freebooters"" stealing his content. Mr. Neistat sat down with CMO Today to discuss his career as a video creator and entrepreneur, and how companies can make better branded content with YouTubers."
2016^"  Ms. Rae, who first found fame on YouTube with her comedy series ""The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,"" is about to launch the show ""Insecure"" on HBO. The show is part of a growing number of shows focused on black characters, including ABC's ""Black-ish"" and Fox's ""Empire."""
2016^  [...]one of the first Revelmode projects will be an animated series featuring numerous members of the team, Maker Studios said.
2016^  On Monday, Mr. Steinberg will debut a new subscription video-on-demand service for Cheddar priced at $6.99 a month, powered by IAC/InterActiveCorp's video platform Vimeo.
2016^  Passing through a convention floor bustling with vendors, businesses and a host of opportunities for selfies, fans perused books published by CBS Corp.'s Simon &amp; Schuster Inc., which has produced many of the YouTubers' books.
2016^  [...]protecting against data collection is not as big of an issue when it comes to YouTube videos featuring paying sponsors, said Mr. Collins.
2016^  [...]research firms like Nielsen and comScore are constantly evolving their digital ad tracking products.
2016^  Ryder Carroll is a bike-sharing, glasses-wearing product designer from Brooklyn, NY. Early in March, they met in a crowded coffee shop. No one recognized the 35-year-old, even though he's a cult Internet celebrity: Carroll invented the Bullet Journal system, a method for note-taking and day planning that people who love paper and pens swear by. Carroll's How to Bullet Journal instructional videos have been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube. Devotees make their own videos and post journal photos to Instagram, where a search for #bulletjournal returns more than 66,000 results. Carroll didn't consider promoting his method -- or even naming it -- until he offered help to a co-worker overwhelmed by planning her wedding.
2016^  Smosh Live, which was filmed live in a YouTube production studio in Los Angeles at 5 p.m. PST on Friday, peaked at nearly 58,000 concurrent viewers, said Keith Richman, president of the digital media company Defy Media, which operates Smosh.
2016^  Some marketers still view digital media and TV as completely separate entities that warrant separate budgets. [...]some TV ad buyers may not even have the ability to move money from a TV network to YouTube because those budgets are managed separately.
2016^  Suddenly, it seems, the whole world is live-streaming. Thanks to Facebook, Google (YouTube), Amazon.com (Twitch), and Twitter (Periscope), anyone even vaguely interested in broadcasting live video online can figure out how to do it. The sales pitches from these companies are simple: stream first, ask questions later. And as with the heyday of blogging a decade ago, the live-streaming gold rush means there's money for anyone selling shovels. In this case, that translates to the technical hardware, software, and know-how needed to make amateur live video look more professional. One of the early leaders in this growing subset of America's online video ad market is the aptly named Livestream, a Brooklyn, NY, startup that's raised $17 million since its 2007 founding.
2016^  The app rocketed to the top of the rankings in Apple's app store in early 2013 within weeks of its debut, resonating with young people who were drawn to the short, snappy format.
2016^  The Beme app will be shuttered, with the company's 11 employees joining CNN to form a separate technology unit focusing on the new media venture and CNN's wider mobile video efforts.
2016^  The bulk of the money is going to media companies such as BuzzFeed and New York Times Co. However, about 15% of the recipients named in the document are internet celebrities more typically seen on Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube, Twitter Inc.'s video-sharing platform Vine, disappearing photo app Snapchat or Facebook's Instagram.
2016^  [...]the company has taken on an array of new roles in the past few years -- raising the question of where the service fits into a world awash with streaming video. To understand what YouTube is and what it wants to become, The Wall Street Journal's Dennis Berman spoke with the company's chief executive officer, Susan Wojcicki.
2016^  The European Union's executive branch this week is expected to propose a broad package of copyright reforms that, among other things, would help musicians and their record companies earn more by making streaming services such as Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube beef up their ability to fight piracy.
2016^  The eye-popping funding speaks to the power of original web content aimed at audiences that aren't typically served by traditional media outside of Adult Swim, coupled with the power of using social media ad targeting and digital influencers.
2016^  The facility, located in Silicon Beach, Santa Monica, will house content production capabilities to strengthen the quality and turnaround time of influencers' content, business support services, and conference rooms to conduct business meetings.
2016^  The initiative, dubbed Roker Labs, has resulted in the formation of something of a multi-channel network for live streaming video; the venture has helped develop shows, use data to inform programming, and even sell ad opportunities to marketers.
2016^  The list reviewed by the Journal also includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Museum of Natural History in New York; internet celebrities such as Logan Paul, Andrew Bachelor and Lele Pons; DJs Armin Van Buuren and Hardwell; and sports teams such as FC Barcelona.
2016^"  [...]there is a ""high demand"" for advertisers to have their messages reach individuals in places online that they are turning to for information about the election, he said."
2016^  The series was commissioned for Kimberly-Clark by Shift2, a branded entertainment agency based in Toronto that specializes in helping marketers connect with millennials, and is produced by Smokebomb Entertainment, a production company that works frequently with Shift2. Since it made its debut in 2014, 72 episodes have been released and most are about five minutes long.
2016^  Translink Capital partner Eric Hsia sits on the company's board, as does Jun Iwasaki, the president and chief executive of Japanese videogame maker GungHo Online Entertainment.
2016^"  Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the onus is on creators to flag infringing content to companies, who are obligated to respond to those ""take-down requests."" [...]of the case, YouTube was pushed to develop its ""Content ID"" matching technology that helps screen out copyright-infringing content."
2016^  Unlike social media-focused ad agencies, or even boutique firms that specialize in brokering deals between brands and small groups of influencers, these newer entrants are focused on software and data platforms geared for helping ad buyers find influencers who might be appropriate for a particular advertiser.
2016^  Verizon Communications once aspired to be the Comcast of mobile, streaming movies and television shows to its 107 million monthly subscribers. Now it wants to be YouTube, feeding short video clips to millennials, who spend more hours each day glued to the tiny screens of their phones than they spend sitting in front of a television. Verizon's Go90, named after people's tendency to flip their phone sideways to watch movies and videos, premiered as an app for Apple and Android phones in October and is avail able to customers of other carriers. In a move that may tip the playing field, Verizon announced in early February that data usage on Go90 won't count toward customers' caps. Using the trove of information it has collected on its wireless subscribers, including age, gender, general interests, and location, Verizon says it can help marketers flash their ads to the right people at the right time.
2016^"  [...]Vine lacks an ad product like Twitter's ""promoted tweet"" or Snapchat's sponsored geofilters, meaning that if a brand wants Vine as part of an ad campaign, it has to work with individual creators (or make their own Vines and pay to promote them on Twitter). Misha Talavera, co-founder at the social influencer agency NeoReach, said that in the last quarter, while marketing spend for social media ""influencers"" increased, demand for branded content on Vine has steadily decreased."
2016^  When NBC and Fox created Hulu 10 years ago, they offered customers something they'd never had before: last night's television shows available over the Internet for free. It presaged the future of television -- online and on-demand, no VCR or DVR required. By the time Mike Hopkins took over as Hulu's CEO in 2013, that early advantage had been mostly squandered. Netflix was laying the groundwork for a global television network, and Amazon.com was about to release a slate of video programs. Now Hopkins hopes his company -- owned by Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Walt Disney, and Time Warner -- can again lead the industry by becoming the first streaming service to couple live television with a wide library of on-demand programs that goes beyond what traditional cable offers.
2016^  [...]YouTube is the dominant force for user-generated video and offers ad-supported music videos and even feature-length movies.
2016^  YouTube this year has been meeting with major record companies and artist-management firms, asking which acts they want help developing and then offering financial support for custom-tailored marketing campaigns--something it hasn't done in the past for musicians.
2017^As a former tour manager for Bob Dylan and The Band, Jonathan Taplin isn't your typical academic. Lately, though, he's been busy writing somber tomes about market shares, monopolies, and online platforms. His conclusion: Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google have become too big and too powerful and, if not stopped, may need to be broken up. Taplin, 70, author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy, knows digital media, having run the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. Ten years before YouTube, he founded one of the first video-on-demand streaming services. He also knows media M&amp;A as a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in the 1980s. He says Google is as close to a monopoly as the Bell telephone system was in 1956. Taplin suggests that authorities look to 1956, when the US forced Bell Labs to license its patents to all corners. The result
2017^Disney has been integrating Maker, which it acquired in 2014 for $675 million, into its consumer-products and interactive-business unit since December in an attempt to find a winning strategy for the business , which had been flailing. The vast majority of people in Maker's YouTube network have made very little...
2017^"""Evil unicorns"" aren't billion-dollar startups gone bad. The term, coined by Google engineers, refers to webpages full of lies about an obscure subject. When there's little other information about the subject online, the lie-stuffed pages get pushed to the top of search results, because the search engine doesn't have much else to show. That's what happened in October, after the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured more than 500. For hours, Google searches about the massacre prominently displayed posts coordinated to falsely identify a Democratic donor critical of Donald Trump as the shooter. Something similar happened in November after the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, TX. YouTube videos and tweets mislabeled the shooter as ""antifa,"" an antifascist protester often willing to use violence. While Google is accustomed to battling spammers and click-bait publishers to maintain the integrity of its search results, it's done less to fight back against the deliberate poisoning of its real-time news and video catalogs."
2017^Facebook has been testing in-stream ads in videos over 90 seconds long for a number of months, but the addition of Watch content could create a host of new ad space for video advertisers to fill, provided the new shows succeed in attracting viewers and holding their attention.The addition of in-stream-only ad options might help attract ad dollars from marketers who have been reluctant to buy video ads in the news feed over concerns about the amount of time people actually view their ads.
2017^"Google, part of Alphabet Inc., and Facebook together accounted for 99% of the online ad industry's growth last year, according to Pivotal Research. While the newer ad formats drove a 52% surge in the number of clicks, they are less lucrative than search ads, Google's legacy business. ""There are real questions there that we need to manage well,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said, of the company's embrace of video as a future source of ad revenue. Ads..."
2017^In the past 25 years the cost of broadcast rights for English Premier League soccer has surged thirty-fold as deep-pocketed media companies have grown to depend on live sports to win subscribers and keep them from defecting to online rivals. Next year an even richer bunch -- those same Internet giants that are wooing television viewers -- will likely show up at rights auctions, pushing prices even higher. Live sports attracts a passionate fan base, Greg Hart, video chief at Amazon.com Inc, said in August after signing a deal to offer Association of Tennis Professionals matches on Prime Video.
2017^"Mr. Zuckerberg had made a snap decision near the end of a product meeting in his glass-walled office in Menlo Park, Calif., to work around the clock to roll out Facebook Live, which took just two months. According to a tally by The Wall Street Journal, people have used Facebook Live to broadcast at least 50 acts of violence, including murder, suicides and the beating in January of a mentally disabled teenager in Chicago. The company was sharply criticized last July for removing live video from Minnesota woman Diamond Reynolds, who showed her boyfriend, Philando Castile, dying after being shot by a police officer during a traffic stop. The bad and good consequences reflect the inherent tension in Mr. Zuckerberg's vision of Facebook as a crucial part of the world's ""social infrastructure,"" a term he used in a nearly 6,000-word manifesto last month. More than a decade ago, YouTube offered a way to share videos without passing through traditional media channels and their careful editorial principles and federal decency guidelines, and the short delay to catch inappropriate content. [...]the young people who seemed to be taking an interest in Facebook Live were in the same demographic group that was drifting away from Facebook in favor of apps such as disappearing-message service Snapchat. Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami and vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a group focused on stopping online abuse, said Facebook was naive about how Facebook Live would be used...."
2017^"One evening in June 2016, Isaac Larian lay in bed at his Malibu, CA, home, unable to sleep. So the CEO of the world's largest private toy company, MGA Entertainment Inc, did what any insomniac toy CEO would do to unwind: He watched viral videos of kids unboxing toys on YouTube. Videos by youthful toy reviewers can get millions of views, and watching toys being freed from their packaging has become must-see television for many fans. This year, MGA's newest product, the L.O.L. Big Surprise has landed at the top of many 2017 best toy lists. It sold out at both Toys ""R"" Us and Amazon.com on the first day it went on sale -- again, without a single television spot. To Larian, whose company created such hits as Bratz and Lalaloopsy dolls, the success validates his decision several years ago to shift away from running spots during kids' television and cable programming and instead depend mainly on getting MGA's products into the hands of kid influencers on YouTube."
2017^Snapchat makes things a lot tougher. Armstrong has followers there, too, but he doesn't know exactly how many. And because of the way the service works, it's hard for him to track how many people watch the sponsored messages he sprinkles into his posts. To capture the audience for a recent video for Toyota Motor Co, he had to set an alarm on his iPhone for 23 hours and 59 minutes after the post to remind him to take a screen shot of the number of viewers. He was cutting it close: Like most Snapchat posts, the video disappeared at the 24-hour mark, taking his proof with it. The company doesn't send executives to VidCon, the influencer conference in Anaheim, CA, where Instagram and its corporate parent, Facebook Inc, have a heavy presence. There's no special Snapchat team catering to the pitchmen and no easy way for the influencers to tell how many views they're getting, making it less obvious why the Lexuses of the world should pay them.
2017^"The juggernaut that is the Minnesota high-school boys' hockey tournament has lately had to make room for a new tradition: the annual All Hockey Hair Team viral video.The first annual All Hockey Hair Team video was a poorly edited, tongue-in-cheek celebration of the hairstyles of the players, from mullets to man buns.During the televised broadcasts of the opening games of the high-school tournament in Minnesota, each player is introduced and skates toward the camera, helmet off and hair flowing.[...]I would have concerns that [a player is] thinking about things other than the game,"" Mark Manney, the boys' hockey director at Minnesota Hockey, the local affiliate of national hockey governing body USA Hockey. ""Is the sideshow gettin' too big?"" Mr. King reassured his viewers in that video.Because hockey hair is a commitment."
2017^"When CNN acquired Casey Neistat's social app Beme last fall, the news organization said that by this summer, the pair would have a stand-alone media company focused on ""timely and topical video and empowering content creators to use technology to find their voice."" [...]rethinking news content for a much younger..."
2017^When Facebook Inc wants to try something new, one of its first calls is to CNN. It was a key partner when Facebook introduced its news-reading app, Paper, in 2014. When the social network shuttered Paper soon after, transmogrifying it into a series of fast-loading News Feed stories called Instant Articles, CNN remained on board. And last year, CNN was one of the few parties to which it paid a nominal fee to produce clips of, say, election results being projected on the Empire State Building. But strain is showing in the relationship. Facebook's latest pitch to publishers such as CNN is for them to provide a regular stream of television-quality, edited, original videos that will give Mark Zuckerberg's company a chance to compete with YouTube and siphon some of the $70 billion pouring into television ads each year. In exchange, the publishers can share some Of the revenue for ads that roll in the middle of the videos. Facebook will control all the ad sales.
2017^YouTube viewers world-wide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, threatening to eclipse U.S. television viewership, a milestone fueled by the Google unit's aggressive embrace of artificial intelligence to recommend videos.YouTube's billion-hour mark underscores the wide lead of the 12-year-old platform in online video--threatening traditional television, which lacks similarly sophisticated tools.YouTube's success using tailor-made video lineups illustrates how technology companies can reshape media consumption into narrow categories of interests, a trend some observers find worrying.Google embeds YouTube videos in search results and pre-installs the YouTube app on its Android software, which runs 88% of smartphones, according to Strategy Analytics.[...]last year YouTube partnered with Google Brain, which develops advanced machine-learning software called deep neural networks, which have led to dramatic improvements in other fields, such as language translation.
2017^  After news outlets highlighted such cases in recent weeks, some big advertisers reduced or pulled their spending from YouTube and the company promised changes to better police content and give marketers more transparency and control.
2017^  A week after Google apologized for running customers' advertisements alongside objectionable videos, triggering a change in policy, its YouTube site is still rife with examples that are angering big advertisers and causing some to cut spending with the tech giant. Google's automated system placed ads for some of the world's biggest brands -- including Coca-Cola Co., Procter &amp; Gamble, Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. -- on five YouTube videos peddling racist and anti-Semitic content, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal.
2017^"  For years, YouTube has served up almost every imaginable kind of video. The site's top trending attractions on a recent afternoon included clips of a gymnasium roof collapsing in the Czech Republic, a colossal alligator lumbering across a footpath in Florida, some North Korean refugees digging into American barbecue for the first time, and a guy demonstrating how to wash a car with a baby. Now, a dozen years after its creation and about a decade after its absorption into Google Inc, YouTube is on the verge of adding yet one more genre -- a category of programming that has long eluded it. YouTube is finally getting regular television. Subscribers will be able to watch YouTube television on smartphones, tablets, laptop computers - pretty much however they want. The mobile apps are designed to easily ""cast"" from smartphones to larger screens, perhaps even -- for older people -- actual television sets. Throughout the app, native YouTube content will be layered in alongside the network shows."
2017^  HSBC Holdings PLC and L'Oreal SA reduced spending with the technology giant after news reports that Google regularly placed their ads on controversial websites or YouTube videos, including some made by supporters of terrorist groups such as Islamic State and a violent pro-Nazi faction. [...]with estimates showing spending on digital ads surpassing that on television ads last year in the U.S., increasing scrutiny from advertisers is forcing internet companies to take more responsibility for the content on which they run ads.
2017^  In 2012, Google researchers found a whimsical way to show off the power of the company's artificial intelligence (AI) technology: They trained computers to recognize cats in YouTube videos. The project took years to pull off and required 16,000 computer processors to analyze 10 million images. That type of AI, known as deep learning, now powers Amazon.com's smart speaker Echo and Tesla's self-driving cars. While such software can seem magical, it still typically requires thousands of computers to spend months scanning millions of data points. Ben Vigoda, an MIT-trained computer scientist (and nephew of late actor Abe Vigoda), says he can cut out most of the grunt work and make AI projects doable for businesses without Google-level resources.
2017^"  Mr. Taplin proposes some thought-provoking solutions to the challenge of getting people to pay for content: e.g., more robust guidelines from the Library of Congress on ""fair use"" (which is now a loophole for posting more than is ""fair"") and, in the music industry, the tiered release of songs so that creators can take in revenues before the songs appear on platforms such as Spotify."
2017^  Selling ads against user-generated content was always a risky proposition, in which Google and its advertisers indulged with their eyes open on Google's YouTube platform. This predictable challenge has produced an alleged crisis for the internet, as businesses as diverse as Hyundai, McDonald's and L'Oreal march off in a huff and say they can no longer advertise on YouTube. That ads are ending up next to content they find inappropriate and offensive might seem a big yawn. Google's algorithms are good at picking out which viewers are likely to bite on which ads, then good at tracking these users across the web even when they linger on sites devoted to anti-Semitic rants or terrorism promotion.
2017^"  ""The problem is thorny because not only is there such a long tail [of sites and videos], but there's so much subjectivity to what is or is not appropriate,"" said Adam Kleinberg, head of San Francisco ad agency Traction Corp. For years, advertisers have increased spending with Google, which helped pioneer the automated ad-buying system, called programmatic advertising, that gives marketers the reach and accuracy to target specific audiences on far corners of the Internet."
2017^"  ""YouTube and even Disney have some blame in this situation,"" said Adam Kleinberg, head of San Francisco ad agency Traction Corp. ""YouTube is marketing their influencer network as a safe place for brands to interact . . . and [PewDiePie] is their biggest property."""
2017^  Zero-rating involves internet service providers giving customers free data services, such as unlimited video streaming. Based on Mr. Pai's public statements and recent actions, the FCC chairman appears to oppose the Obama-era FCC judgment that the commission has the power to regulate internet service providers the way it regulates telecoms more broadly.
